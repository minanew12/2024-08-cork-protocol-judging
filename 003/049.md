# Functions that should be called trough a proxy contract implement the notDelegated modifier

### Summary

The ``AssetFactory.sol`` and ``FlashSwapRouter.sol`` contracts both inherit the UUPSUpgradeable contract from Openzeppelin, indicating that the owners of the protocol would like to update the contracts at some time in the future. However important functions in those contracts implement the **notDelegated** modifier which forbids for those functions to be called via proxy, making the whole protocol obsolete. 
```solidity
    modifier notDelegated() {
        _checkNotDelegated();
        _;
    }
```

```solidity
    function _checkNotDelegated() internal view virtual {
        if (address(this) != __self) {
            // Must not be called through delegatecall
            revert UUPSUnauthorizedCallContext();
        }
    }
```

In the ``AssetFactory.sol`` contract the functions that implement the **notDelegated** modifier but shouldn't are the following:
 - [initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/assets/AssetFactory.sol#L48-L51)
 - [deploySwapAssets()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/assets/AssetFactory.sol#L140-L166)
 - [deployLv()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/assets/AssetFactory.sol#L175-L193)
 
 In the ``FlashSwapRouter.sol`` contract the functions that implement the **notDelegated** modifier but shouldn't are the following:
- [initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L32-L37)
- [_authorizeUpgrade()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L41)

### Root Cause

The use of the **notDelegated** modifier in different functions, bricks important functionality of the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

The ``AssetFactory.sol`` and ``FlashSwapRouter.sol`` contracts are used trough a proxy

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The whole protocol will be obsolete as it won't even be initialized, and deploying CT and DS  assets won't be possible. Why the devs wrote upgradeable contracts, and then decided to implement the **notDelegated** modifier is a question for a higher power.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the **notDelegated** operator from the above mentioned functions, and read about how proxies are supposed to work.
