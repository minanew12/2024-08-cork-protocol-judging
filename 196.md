# Interactions with AMMs do not use deadlines for operations, exposing transactions to potential front-running risks

## Summary

The absence of a deadline parameter in AMM interactions allows a malicious actor, such as a miner, to delay the execution of the transaction, exploiting maximum slippage or profiting from other market changes. This is especially critical in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols where timing-sensitive operations are involved. The lack of deadline checks can create an opportunity for front-running and other miner-exploited vulnerabilities, resulting in financial losses or disrupted operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

Front-running is a significant concern in the design of Automated Market Makers (AMMs). By omitting the deadline parameter in operations that interact with AMMs, miners can delay the transaction intentionally, creating conditions where slippage is maximized. This delay can lead to situations where the transaction incurs higher-than-expected slippage or fails to execute under favorable conditions.

```solidity
function _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt(
    State storage self,
    uint256 dsId,
    IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
    IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
    uint256 ammCtBalance
) internal returns (uint256 ra) {
    uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);

    uint256 redeemAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? ammCtBalance : reservedDs;

    reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReservePartial(self.info.toId(), dsId, redeemAmount);

    ra += redeemAmount;
    PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(self, redeemAmount, dsId);

    uint256 ctSellAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? 0 : ammCtBalance - reservedDs;

    DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
    address[] memory path = new address[](2);
    path[0] = ds.ct;
    path[1] = self.info.pair1;

    ERC20(ds.ct).approve(address(ammRouter), ctSellAmount);

    if (ctSellAmount != 0) {
        // 100% tolerance, to ensure this not fail
 @>>       ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp)[1];
    }
}
```
Specifically, the function `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt` interacts with UniswapV2 without including a deadline, allowing miners to hold the transaction, especially when liquidations or slippage are involved. In such cases, the miner may prioritize other transactions that are more profitable or delay the transaction to worsen the slippage condition.

## Impact

A miner can strategically withhold a transaction from being mined until the slippage is at its maximum, leading to a significant financial loss for the user. Additionally, if the transaction is performed to free up capital to avoid a liquidation, a miner may instead allow the liquidation to occur, profiting from follow-on transactions. The absence of deadline parameters in AMM-related functions creates a critical vulnerability that can be exploited, leading to significant financial damage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce a `deadline` argument to all functions that interact with AMMs, including `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt`. This parameter should be passed along to all AMM-related function calls (such as `swapExactTokensForTokens`) to ensure that transactions are executed within a specified time frame, protecting them from miner delays and front-running exploits.

Example:

```solidity
ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this), deadline)[1];
```
