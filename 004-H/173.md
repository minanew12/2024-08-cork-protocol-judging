# Users repurchasing will transfer funds to the vault without tracking the `Ra` deposited which will leave stuck `Ra` in the `Psm`

### Summary

[Psm::repurchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L34) calls [PsmLib::repurchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L293) which transfers [Pa](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L315) and [Ds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L318) to the user and [receives](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L310) `Ra` in return. However, this `Ra` is not [added](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/RedemptionAssetManagerLib.sol#L65) to `self.psm.balances.ra.locked`, which means that users will not be able to redeem it via [Psm::redeemRaWithDs()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L123) or [Psm::redeemWithCt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L183) as the amount locked would [underflow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L188) due to not having been increased earlier, or in case of `Psm::redeemWithCt()`, the [checkpointed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L73) amount would not [include](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/RedemptionAssetManagerLib.sol#L42) the received amount.

### Root Cause

In `PsmLib:310`, `self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);` is called instead of `self.psm.balances.ra.lockfrom(amount, buyer);`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Users repurchase `Pa` and `Ds` by selling `Ra` via `Psm::repurchase()`.

### Impact

Loss of the `Ra` transferred in `Psm::repurchase()`.

### PoC

`PsmLib::repurchase()` calls `self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);`
```solidity
function repurchase(
    State storage self,
    address buyer,
    uint256 amount,
    IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
    IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
) internal returns (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 feePrecentage, uint256 fee, uint256 exchangeRates) {
    ...
    self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer); //@audit does not track RAs
    ...
}
```

`RedemptionAssetManagerLib::lockUnchecked()` does not increase the locked amount of `Ra`.
```solidity
function lockUnchecked(PsmRedemptionAssetManager storage self, uint256 amount, address from) internal {
    IERC20(self._address).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
}
```

### Mitigation

In `PsmLib:310`, replace `self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);` with `self.psm.balances.ra.lockfrom(amount, buyer);`.
