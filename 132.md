# Deadline cannot be block.timestamp in `VaultLib::_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt`

### Summary

on line 345 of `VaultLib::_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt`, the function `swapExactTokensForTokens()` is called but the deadline parameter of the function is initialised to block.timestamp which offers no protection

### Root Cause

on [line 345](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L345) the `deadline` param of the `swapExactTokensForTokens` is being initialised to block.timestamp

### Internal pre-conditions

whenever user calls `redeemEarlyLv` in the vault contract.

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-con

### Attack Path

1. When user calls `redeemEarlyLv`
2. Then it makes a call to the vaultlib `redeemEarly` using the current state storage
3. A call is made to _liquidateLpPartial
4. then we try to _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt 
5. in `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt` a call is made to `ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens`.
6. which makes an external call to uniswaps router v2 with the provided data

### Impact

There is no real protection or deadline

### PoC

looking into the function the problem is from this line 
`ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this),block.timestamp)[1];`

which intend makes a `swapExactTokensForTokens` call to an amm router which is uniswapV2's router02, which looks like this;

```solidity
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        uint amountIn,
        uint amountOutMin,
        address[] calldata path,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external virtual override ensure(deadline) returns (uint[] memory amounts) {
```
so as we can see, in the function declaration there is an ensure modifier which makes sure the deadline has not passed.

```solidity
    modifier ensure(uint deadline) {
        require(deadline >= block.timestamp, 'UniswapV2Router: EXPIRED');
        _;
    }
```

so evaluating when you have a deadline of block.timestamp, we can confirm deadline will never be reached, because block.timestamp == block.timestamp always.

### Mitigation

Add a real deadline either a user passed in timestamp or any other implementation
