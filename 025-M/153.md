# Wrong accounting of locked RA when redeeming RA with DS

## Summary

Users have the option to redeem RA by providing DS + PA to the PSM. When they redeem RA, a fee is applied to the amount of RA redeemed, and this fee is used to mint CT for providing liquidity to the AMM pair. However, during this process, the protocol fails to correctly account for the amount of RA that remains locked in the PSM.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of `Psm.redeemRaWithDs()`, two key operations are performed:

1. Sending the corresponding amount of RA to the user in exchange for DS + PA,
2. Providing liquidity with the fee generated from the RA redemption.

```solidity
function redeemRaWithDs(Id id, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount, bytes memory rawDsPermitSig, uint256 deadline)
        external
        override
        nonReentrant
        onlyInitialized(id)
        PSMWithdrawalNotPaused(id)
    {
        State storage state = states[id];
        // gas savings
        uint256 feePrecentage = psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage;

        (uint256 received, uint256 _exchangeRate, uint256 fee) =
            state.redeemWithDs(_msgSender(), amount, dsId, rawDsPermitSig, deadline, feePrecentage);

        VaultLibrary.provideLiquidityWithFee(state, fee, getRouterCore(), getAmmRouter());

        emit DsRedeemed(id, dsId, _msgSender(), amount, received, _exchangeRate, feePrecentage, fee);
    }
```

In`PsmLib._afterRedeemWithDs()` the amount unlocked is equal to the converted RA (from DS + PA) minus the fee.
```solidity
function _afterRedeemWithDs(
        State storage self,
        DepegSwap storage ds,
        address owner,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 feePrecentage
    ) internal returns (uint256 received, uint256 _exchangeRate, uint256 fee) {
        IERC20(ds._address).transferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);

        _exchangeRate = ds.exchangeRate();
        received = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, _exchangeRate);

        // @audit-issue incorrect order of params
        fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(received, feePrecentage);
        received -= fee;

        IERC20(self.info.peggedAsset().asErc20()).safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);

        // @audit wrong accounting of locked value
        self.psm.balances.ra.unlockTo(owner, received);
    }
```

The amount that is unlocked is the (converted RA from DS+PA) - fee.

The `VaultLib.__provideLiquidity()` function is used to send RA and CT tokens derived from the redemption fee to the AMM pair.
```solidity
function __provideLiquidity(
        State storage self,
        uint256 raAmount,
        uint256 ctAmount,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        address ctAddress,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
        uint256 dsId
    ) internal {
        // no need to provide liquidity if the amount is 0
        if (raAmount == 0 && ctAmount == 0) {
            return;
        }

        PsmLibrary.unsafeIssueToLv(self, ctAmount);

        __addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked(self, raAmount, ctAmount, self.info.redemptionAsset(), ctAddress, ammRouter);

        _addFlashSwapReserve(self, flashSwapRouter, self.ds[dsId], ctAmount);
    }
```

`PsmLibrary.unsafeIssueToLv()` accounts for the locked amount of RA from the providing liquidity. The amount is equal to the amount of CT tokens sent to the AMM.
```solidity
function unsafeIssueToLv(State storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
        uint256 dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;

        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];

        self.psm.balances.ra.incLocked(amount);

        ds.issue(address(this), amount);
    }
```

Consider the following scenario:
For simplicity the minted values in the example may not be accurate, but the idea is to show the wrong accounting of locked RA.

1. PSM has 1000 RA locked.
2. Alice provide 100 DS+PA and we have fee=5%
3. Fee is 5 RA, so Alice would receive 95 RA
4. After `_afterRedeemWithDs()` the locked amount is equal to 905 (1000 initial RA - 95 for Alice), fee stays locked.
5. In `__provideLiquidity()` let say 3 of those 5 RA are used to mint CT+DS.
6. `PsmLibrary.unsafeIssueToLv()` would add 3 RA to the locked amount, making the psm.balances.ra.locked = 908.

This is incorrect because the real amount of RA locked is 905 3 used to provide liquidity are already accounted from before since fee was not deducted from the initial amount
## Impact

Wrong accounting of locked RA would lead to over-distribution of rewards for users + after time last users to redeem might not be able to redeem as there wont be enough RA in the contract due to previous over-distribution. This breaks a core functionality of the protocol and the likelihood of this happening is very high, making the overall severity High.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider not accounting the RA used to mint CT+DS in this scenario as it is already accounted. Directly changing `unsafeIssueToLv()` may not be an option as it is used in other places as well. Another option is to remove the fee from the locked amount in `_afterRedeemWithDs()`.
