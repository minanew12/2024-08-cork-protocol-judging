# `PERMIT APPROVALS` is vulnerable to DOS via frontrunning

## Summary
`PERMIT APPROVALS` is vulnerable to DOS via frontrunning

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PERMIT APPROVALS`  is intended to allow off-chain signed approvals to be used on-chain, saving gas and improving user experience. These have been used in function's `PsmLib:redeemWithDs` , `PsmLib:redeemRaWithCtDs`, `PsmLib:redeemWithCt`.

An attacker can observe the transaction in the mempool, extract the permit signature and values from the calldata and execute the permit before the original transaction is processed. This would consume the nonce associated with the user's permit and cause the original transaction to fail due to the now-invalid nonce.

This attack vector has been previously described in [Permission Denied - The Story of an EIP that Sinned](https://www.trust-security.xyz/post/permission-denied) .


## Impact
Failing of transactions  damaging core functionality of protocol.
