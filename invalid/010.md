# amount out value will be truncated in the swap Math Library

### Summary

In `DsSwapperMathLib.sol` library, `getAmountOut()` computes the amount of out tokens using the reserves and the exchange rate. But, due to lack of proper scaling, the result returned will be truncated.

Note how the amountOut amount is computed.

```solidity
    amountOut = amountIn / dsPrice; 
```

### Root Cause

The issue is lack of scaling as once the value is divided by `dsPrice` which is 1e18, inorder to maintain the scaling, the value should be multiplied with 1e18. Also, as there is risk of loosing resolution, the multiple should be performed before division.

### Impact

The output amount returned will be incorrect.

### Mitigation

To fix the issue, the implementation should be revised as below.

```solidity
function getAmountOut(
        uint256 amountIn, // Amount of input tokens
        uint112 reserveIn, // Reserve of the input token
        uint112 reserveOut, // Reserve of the other token (needed for price ratio calculation)
        uint256 dsExchangeRate // DS exchange rate
    ) external pure returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        if (amountIn == 0) {
            revert InsufficientInputAmount();
        }

        if (reserveIn == 0 || reserveOut == 0) {
            revert InsufficientLiquidity();
        }

        uint256 dsPrice = calculateDsPrice(reserveIn, reserveOut, dsExchangeRate);

-      amountOut = amountIn / dsPrice;
+     amountOut = amountIn * 1e18 / dsPrice;
    }
```
