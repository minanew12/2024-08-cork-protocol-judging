# Missing Cancel Redemption Functionality

## Summary 

The VaultCore contract is missing a function to cancel redemption requests, which prevents users from withdrawing their locked assets.

## Vulnerability Details

The contract allows users to request redemptions via the `requestRedemption()` function. However, there is no way for a user to cancel a pending redemption if they change their plans before the redemption date. 
```solidity
    function cancelRedemptionRequest(State storage self, address owner, uint256 amount) external {
        safeBeforeExpired(self);
        uint256 userEligible = self.vault.pool.withdrawEligible[owner];

        if (userEligible == 0) {
            revert Unauthorized(msg.sender);
        }

        if (userEligible < amount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance(owner, amount, userEligible);
        }

        self.vault.pool.withdrawEligible[owner] -= amount;
        self.vault.pool.withdrawalPool.atrributedLv -= amount;
        self.vault.lv.unlockTo(amount, owner);
    }
```
Once a redemption is requested, the locked assets are set aside for withdrawal but remain inaccessible until expiry. The user has no way to regain control over the assets.

## Impact

Users are unable to cancel redemption requests if their circumstances change before expiry. This could lead to locked funds being inaccessible when needed.

## Tool Used

Manual code review

## Recommendation

Implement a `cancelRedemptionRequest()` function that allows users to cancel pending redemptions by reducing the eligible withdrawal amount and unlocking the associated locked assets.
