# Incorrect validation allows admin to set excessive base redemption fees affecting users violating the given spec

### Summary

Incorrect validation on the constructor parameter will allow setting an excessive psm base redemption fee percentage for users as admin can deploy the contract with an unchecked fee value.

### Root Cause

In ModuleState.sol constructor, the validation check is performed on the state variable psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage instead of the input parameter _psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage, which will always pass irrespective of the input value.

```solidity 
constructor(
    address _swapAssetFactory,
    address _ammFactory,
    address _dsFlashSwapRouter,
    address _ammRouter,
    address _config,
    uint256 _psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage
) {
    if (psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage > 5 ether) {
        revert InvalidFees();
    }
  
    psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage = _psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage;
}
```

### Attack Path

1. Admin deploys the contract with _psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage set to a value greater than 5 ether (5%).
2. The constructor assigns this excessive value to the state variable psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage due to incorrect validation.
3. The contract is now initialized with an excessive fee percentage.

### Impact

The users suffer from excessive fees during redemption operations. The protocol gains these excessive fees from users, which goes against the intended design of limiting fees to a maximum of 5%.
This issue contradicts the specification which states:

> Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?
Yes, RepurchaseFeeRate, EarlyRedemptionFeeRate, PsmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage will be between 0 to 5% (0% <= x <= 5%)
