# Incorrect `_psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage` Validation in Constructor of `ModuleState` Contract

## Summary


The constructor of the `ModuleState` contract contains a validation check for the `psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage` variable, ensuring it does not exceed a defined limit of 5 ether. However, the incorrect variable is being checked against the validation condition, leading to an ineffective validation. This results in the potential for invalid fee values to be set, which may lead to erroneous fee calculations in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the constructor, the fee validation logic attempts to restrict the `psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage` to a maximum value of 5 ether:

```solidity
if (psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage > 5 ether) {
    revert InvalidFees();
}
```

However, `psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage` is a state variable that has not been assigned a value at the point where this check occurs. The intention was likely to validate the constructor parameter `_psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage` instead of the uninitialized state variable.

This mistake results in the validation logic being ineffective since it does not actually validate the provided constructor input, allowing for potentially incorrect fee percentages to be set without triggering the expected revert condition.

## Impact

The incorrect variable is being checked against the validation condition, This results in the potential for invalid fee values to be set.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the constructor to validate the `_psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage` parameter rather than the uninitialized `psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage` state variable. This ensures the input is validated correctly before being assigned to the state variable:

```diff
    constructor(
        address _swapAssetFactory,
        address _ammFactory,
        address _dsFlashSwapRouter,
        address _ammRouter,
        address _config,
        uint256 _psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage
    ) {
-        if (psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage > 5 ether) {
+        if (_psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage > 5 ether) {
            revert InvalidFees();
        }
        SWAP_ASSET_FACTORY = _swapAssetFactory;
        AMM_FACTORY = _ammFactory;
        DS_FLASHSWAP_ROUTER = _dsFlashSwapRouter;
        AMM_ROUTER = _ammRouter;
        CONFIG = _config;
        psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage = _psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage;
    }
```
