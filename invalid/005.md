# A malicious user can frontrun permit transaction to make it revert due to invalid signature

### Summary
The `permit()` function in the Asset contract, as invoked by the `DepegSwapLibrary` and `PsmLibrary`, is vulnerable to front-running attacks. This vulnerability arises from the lack of atomicity in the way `permit()` approvals are used, which can lead to denial of service (DoS) or unintended execution of contract logic.

### Root Cause
The `permit()` function from the `ERC20Permit` standard allows users to authorize token spending off-chain using a signed message. However, when this function is part of a contract sequence that includes other actions, such as token transfers or redemptions, it becomes susceptible to front-running. Attackers can observe the signed `permit()` message and submit a transaction using it before the intended transaction, causing failures or unexpected behavior in the contract.

This attack vector has been previously described in [Permission Denied - The Story of an EIP that Sinned](https://www.trust-security.xyz/post/permission-denied) .

### Internal pre-conditions
-   `PsmCore.redeemRaWithDs()`: Calls `PsmLibrary.redeemWithDs()`, which in turn calls `DepegSwapLibrary.permit()`.
-   `PsmCore.redeemWithCT()`: Calls `PsmLibrary.redeemWithCt()`, which similarly calls `DepegSwapLibrary.permit()`.
-   `PsmCore.redeemRaWithCtDs()`: Calls `PsmLibrary.redeemRaWithCtDs()`, which uses `DepegSwapLibrary.permit()` twice.
-   `RouterState::swapRaforDs()`: Calls `DepegSwapLibrary.permit()`.
-   `RouterState::swapDsforRa()`: Calls `DepegSwapLibrary.permit()`.
-    The signed `permit()` message is valid and includes necessary parameters like `owner`, `spender`, `value`, `deadline` and `v`, `r`, `s` from the signature.  


### External pre-conditions
1. An attacker can monitor the Ethereum mempool to capture signed permit messages.
2. The attacker can submit transactions to the network, including using the captured permit signatures to front-run.


### Attack Path
1. An attacker can observe the transaction in the mempool, extract the permit signature and values from the calldata and execute the permit before the original transaction is processed.
2. The attacker submits a transaction using the captured permit signatures to perform a permit() call.
3. The attackerâ€™s transaction executes before the intended transaction, consuming the permit and potentially causing it to expire or become invalid.

### Impact
The original transaction, such as `swapRaforDs()`, `swapDsforRa()`, `redeemRaWithDs()`, `redeemWithCT()`, or `redeemRaWithCtDs()` fails because the permit is no longer valid, resulting in a denial of service for the legitimate user.


### Mitigation
Consider implementing a mechanism in [DepegSwapLibrary::permit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/e77d293c0fbe3ecb6d47ddde9491ade2cf99fbba/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/DepegSwapLib.sol#L42-L53) function to check if an allowance for the desired amount exists in case the call to `permit()` fails. A potential code adjustment could be:
```diff
   function permit(
        address contract_,
        bytes memory rawSig,
        address owner,
        address spender,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal {
       Signature memory sig = MinimalSignatureHelper.split(rawSig);

+      try Asset(contract_).permit(owner, spender, value, deadline, sig.v, sig.r, sig.s) {
+          // Permit executed successfully, proceed
+      } catch {
+          // Check allowance to see if permit was already executed
+          uint256 currentAllowance = Asset(contract_).allowance(owner, spender);
+          if(currentAllowance < value) {
+              revert("Permit failed and allowance insufficient");
+          }
+         // Otherwise, proceed as if permit was successful
+      }

    }
```
This approach ensures that the transaction can proceed if the end state is as expected, even if the permit call itself fails due to front-running or other issues.
