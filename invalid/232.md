# Setting `dsId` to an expired `DS` will lead to the reversal of the `FlashSwapRouter.swapDsforRa()` function

## Summary

There is an exchange of `CT + DS` to `RA` during the `DS` selling process. This exchange can only be performed with the currently activated `DS`. Therefore, setting `dsId` to an expired `DS` will lead to the reversal of the selling.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `FlashSwapRouter.swapDsforRa()` function has a parameter `dsId` (line 251) that represents the selling `DS`.

```solidity
    function swapDsforRa(
        Id reserveId,
251     uint256 dsId,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 amountOutMin,
        bytes memory rawDsPermitSig,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        ...
    }
```

The function `__afterFlashswapSell()` is invoked during the selling process. As you can see at line 394, it exchanges `CT + DS` for `RA`. This exchange can only be performed with the currently activated `DS`, as indicated in the [PsmLib.redeemRaWithCtDs()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/tree/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L205) function. As a result, setting `dsId` to an expired `DS` will lead to the reversal of the transaction.

```solidity
    function __afterFlashswapSell(
        ReserveState storage self,
        uint256 ctAmount,
        Id reserveId,
        uint256 dsId,
        address caller,
        uint256 raAttributed
    ) internal {
        AssetPair storage assetPair = self.ds[dsId];
        assetPair.ds.approve(owner(), ctAmount);
        assetPair.ct.approve(owner(), ctAmount);

        IPSMcore psm = IPSMcore(owner());

394     (uint256 received,) = psm.redeemRaWithCtDs(reserveId, ctAmount);

        // for rounding error and to satisfy uni v2 liquidity rules(it forces us to repay 1 wei higher to prevent liquidity stealing)
        uint256 repaymentAmount = received - raAttributed;

        Asset ra = assetPair.ra;

        assert(repaymentAmount + raAttributed >= received);

        // send caller their RA
        IERC20(ra).safeTransfer(caller, raAttributed);
        // repay flash loan
        IERC20(ra).safeTransfer(msg.sender, repaymentAmount);
    }
```

## Impact

Selling `DS` could be reverted.
