# The cancelRedemptionRequest function does not work properly

## Summary
The `cancelRedemptionRequest` function does not work properly.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user requests redemption, they transfer their LV tokens to `address(this)`, and `withdrawEligible` is incremented by the amount that is requested.

```solidity
self.vault.pool.withdrawEligible[owner] += amount; // per user
self.vault.pool.withdrawalPool.atrributedLv += amount; // sum of users

// LV
self.vault.lv.lockFrom(amount, owner);
```

The `VaultLib` library supports the cancellation of redemption requests, but this function is not callable because it is never used in the `Vault.sol ` contract. Therefore, users will not be able to cancel their redemption requests and retrieve their LV tokens.


```solidity
self.vault.pool.withdrawEligible[owner] -= amount;
self.vault.pool.withdrawalPool.atrributedLv -= amount;

// LV
self.vault.lv.unlockTo(amount, owner);
```

Just for your information, if the cancelRedemptionRequest function is implemented or called in the Vault.sol contract, it will be easy for anyone to call it and cancel the redemption request for everyone

## Impact
Users can not cancel their redemption requests and to retrieve their LV tokens. This is expected behavior, as the `VaultLib` supports this functionality, but it is not properly implemented in the `Vault` contract.

## Recommendation
Implement the `cancelRedemptionRequest` function properly in the `Vault` contract.
