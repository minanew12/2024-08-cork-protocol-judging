# [M-02] Uninitialized State Variable IDTS

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
What is the Uninitialized State Variable vulnerability?
In Solidity, smart contracts may define various state variables at the level of the contract itself, analogous to class members in many object-oriented programming languages. State variables will have default values dictated by the EVM if the variables are not initialized; these may be desired values in some cases, but they may be unexpected in other cases, and failure to initialize them will not prevent a smart contract from compiling even if lack of initialization leads to a logical bug.



Olympix: Using uninitialized state variables may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Recommendation

Always ensure that state variables receive proper values in the contract declaration or via the constructor.
