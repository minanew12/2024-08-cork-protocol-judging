# FlashSwapRouter and AssetRegister contracts backdoor through proxy initialization

## Summary
Due to the nature of the UUPS proxy pattern the implementation contracts (in this case: FlashSwapRouter and AssetRegister) are totally vulnerable of being silently compromised due to a very sophisticated exploit and well-known vulnerbility 

=> In the OpenZeppelin documentation, there is a warning advising against leaving both the proxy and the implementation contract uninitialized ([OpenZeppelin Docs: proxy#Initializable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy#Initializable)), and the CVE-2021-41264 post-mortem discusses the contracts implementation being uninitialized. The key here is having the speed to front-run the proxy initialization. By inspecting deployment transaction data from Ethereum and BSC block explorers, the delay between the "await" transactions appears to be 2 blocks - plenty of time to perform front-running attack on Ethereum Mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail
The deployment and initialization of the FlashSwapRouter and AssetRegister contracts does not occur in the same transaction and knowing that the deployment is being made on Mainnet this open a frontrunning vector.

Vulnerbility lies at deploy.ts:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/scripts/deploy.ts#L115

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/scripts/deploy.ts#L116
 
First and foremost the attack is possible due to the initialization being separated from the deployment transaction and secondly like stated above the await-keyward instruct the code to wait before calling the initialize function which leave a window for an attack.

Instead of writing a PoC and making the report redundant, I've decided that it is better to take a look at [rootedrescue's alpha article](https://rooted.totherescue.xyz/posts/2024_07_27-proxy_hijacking_deployment_script_as_a_vulnerability_enabler) which explains completely how the attack works. 
-> It includes a very sophisticated backdooring contract
-> methods to obfuscate the attack (manipulate storage slots - project can still claim ownership,..)
-> coded exploit (PoC that could be more complex - demonstrate how the proxy could be backdoored) 

**NOTE: The report is using the context of the article (PoC and vector purposes)**
Attack flow:

1. Deployer: Initiates the vulnerable Hardhat deployment script (deploy.ts) to deploy FlashSwapRouter and AssetRegister contracts
2. Attacker: Sees the proxy deployment transaction in the mempool, front-runs it and calls initialize()
3. Attacker: Within the same transaction, the attacker deploys backdoored implementation
4. Attacker: Calls now initialized with upgradeToAndCall(), pointing the implementation to the backdoor contract
5. Attacker: Calls the hidden _storageManipulator(bytes32,bytes32) on the backdoored proxy to manipulate storage
   -> The storage manipulation re-enables the contract to be initialized and removes the attacker from being the owner
6. Deployer: The unsuspecting deployment script continues to execute as intended, calling initialization and other functions
7. Attacker: The attacker has achieved full backdoored access to the proxy and its implementation without being the owner

result: the attacker has backdoored control of the UUPS proxy by adding the additional hidden functionality to the original implementation the attacker has the ability to manipulate contract storage slots and make externall calls, hidden inside a fallback() function which allows the backdoor to keep its original functions intact and to make them visible to any blockchain explorers, such as Etherscan.

## Impact
While the nature of the vulnerability is trivial, the attacker could succesfully control the proxy. And most likely rekt or grief the project through the compromised proxy (e.g FlashSwapRouter - theft of user funds due to allowances) or manipulating of storage slots.) 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The fix is easy, ensure that deployment and initialization occurs in the same transaction by regrouping them in the deployment script.
