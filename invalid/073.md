# The psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage is universal for all the pairs in the protocol

### Summary

The Cork protocol has three different fees that it charges. The RepurchaseFeeRate, and EarlyRedemptionFeeRate are set per pair, however the PsmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage is set universally for all the pairs in the protocol via the [ModuleCore::updatePsmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleCore.sol#L153-L158) function. This severely limits the ability of the protocol to charge different redemption fees for different pairs, based on factors such as their exchange rate and market demand. 

### Root Cause

The psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage is universally set for all the pairs in the protocol

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol can't set different psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage fee for the different pairs that it creates, this limits the ability of the protocol to generate fees, as some pairs where there is bigger demand may generate more fees if the redemption fee is lower, and others may need a higher fee. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Implement functionality that sets the psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage fee per pair.
