# Incorrect Parameter Usage in getAmountIn Calculation in : previewSwapRaforDs Function can lead to wrong preview before swap will return wrong amountOutMin used for swapRaforDs and cause transaction failure.

## Summary
The function `previewSwapRaforDs`is designed to simulate the outcome of a token swap, specifically swapping RA tokens for DS tokens within the Cork protocol. The function includes a call to `getAmountOutBuyDS`, which internally utilizes the `getAmountIn` function to determine the required input amount based on specified output and liquidity pool reserves.

However, a critical discrepancy has been identified within the `getAmountOutBuyDS` function, where the parameter `borrowedAmount` is erroneously passed to `getAmountIn` instead of the correct `amountOut` parameter. This misalignment between the intended logic and the implemented code leads to a flawed calculation of the required input amount (`repaymentAmount`), potentially resulting in severe miscalculations during swap previews.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `previewSwapRaforDs` function is intended to provide an accurate estimate of the DS tokens (`amountOut`) that will be received in exchange for a given amount of RA tokens (amount). The function interacts with several internal mechanisms, including:

- `getAmountOutBuyDS:` Computes the output DS tokens and borrowed amounts based on the input RA tokens.
- `getAmountIn:` Determines the amount of RA tokens required to obtain a specified amount of DS tokens, based on current reserves.

In the `getAmountOutBuyDS` function, the following segment of code introduces a significant logical error:

```solidity
repaymentAmount = MinimalUniswapV2Library.getAmountIn(borrowedAmount, ctReserve, raReserve - borrowedAmount);
```
The [getAmountIn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/e77d293c0fbe3ecb6d47ddde9491ade2cf99fbba/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/uni-v2/UniswapV2Library.sol#L77) function is designed to calculate the input token amount (`amountIn`) necessary to achieve a specific output token amount (`amountOut`), based on the liquidity reserves (reserveIn and (`reserveOut`). The function signature clearly indicates that amountOut should be passed as the first argument:

```solidity
function getAmountIn(uint256 amountOut, uint256 reserveIn, uint256 reserveOut) internal pure returns (uint256 amountIn)
```
However, instead of passing the calculated `amountOut` as intended, the code erroneously passes `borrowedAmount`, a distinct value not aligned with the expected output token amount. This misalignment disrupts the accuracy of the swap preview, leading to potential errors in the subsequent logic.

## Impact
Assume a user intends to swap 100 RA tokens for DS tokens. The function should accurately compute the amountOut (DS tokens) based on the reserves and then determine how many RA tokens are required to achieve that specific amountOut.
If `amountOut` were correctly passed to getAmountIn, the function would accurately calculate the required RA tokens (amountIn) to achieve the specified DS tokens (amountOut), ensuring consistency in swap outcomes.

With the current implementation, the function incorrectly uses `borrowedAmount` instead of `amountOut` in the `getAmountIn` function.
This leads to a miscalculation of the `repaymentAmount`, which does not accurately reflect the correct amount of RA tokens required for the swap.
The user may receive a misleading swap preview, potentially resulting in either overestimating or underestimating the required input tokens, causing financial discrepancies.

This function will not affect any swap transaction directly since it used used as a `amountOutMin` when calling [swapRaforDs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/e77d293c0fbe3ecb6d47ddde9491ade2cf99fbba/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L150). This function will return an incorrect number of `amountOut` and when this would be used when swapping it might lead to transaction failure, if the `amountOut` greater than the amount of Ra to be swapped as the flawed function in `previewSwapRaForDs` is also present in the `swapRaforDs` function

## Code Snippet
```solidity
       ReserveState storage self = reserves[reserveId];
        AssetPair storage assetPair = self.ds[dsId];

        uint256 borrowedAmount;
        (amountOut, borrowedAmount,) = assetPair.getAmountOutBuyDS(amount);  <--------------------------

        // calculate the amount of DS tokens that will be sold from LV reserve
        uint256 amountSellFromReserve =
            amountOut - MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(self.reserveSellPressurePrecentage, amountOut);

        // sell all tokens if the sell amount is higher than the available reserve
        amountSellFromReserve = assetPair.reserve < amountSellFromReserve ? assetPair.reserve : amountSellFromReserve;

        // sell the DS tokens from the reserve if there's any
        if (amountSellFromReserve != 0) {
            (uint112 raReserve, uint112 ctReserve) = assetPair.getReservesSorted();

            // we borrow the same amount of CT tokens from the reserve
            ctReserve -= uint112(amountSellFromReserve);

            (uint256 vaultRa, uint256 raAdded) = assetPair.getAmountOutSellDS(amountSellFromReserve);
            raReserve += uint112(raAdded);

            // emulate Vault way of adding liquidity using RA from selling DS reserve
            (, uint256 ratio) = self.tryGetPriceRatioAfterSellDs(dsId, amountSellFromReserve, raAdded);
            uint256 ctAdded;
            (raAdded, ctAdded) = MathHelper.calculateProvideLiquidityAmountBasedOnCtPrice(vaultRa, ratio);

            raReserve += uint112(raAdded);
            ctReserve += uint112(ctAdded);

            // update amountOut since we sold some from the reserve
            (, amountOut) = SwapperMathLibrary.getAmountOutDs(
                int256(uint256(raReserve)), int256(uint256(ctReserve)), int256(amount)
            );
