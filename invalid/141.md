# `arrayLen` is outdated in  `AssetFactory::getDeployedSwapAssets`

### Summary

The `arrayLen` is not updated after the if statement changes the variables involved in calculating the `arraylen` i.e start and end, therefore resulting in a wrong arrLen value.

### Root Cause

After [line 133](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/assets/AssetFactory.sol#L113) the `arrLen` is not updated

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Caller needs to call `getDeployedSwapAssets`
2. Make sure `if (end > _assets.length)` evaluates true

### External pre-conditions

No ext. pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Call `getDeployedSwapAssets`
2. provide values such that `if (end > _assets.length)` evaluates to true

### Impact

The `arrayLen` becomes outdated and bigger instead of being equal to the length of ct and ds

### PoC

from `AssetFactory::getDeployedSwapAssets` below
```solidity
    function getDeployedSwapAssets(address ra, address pa, uint8 page, uint8 limit)
        external
        view
        override
        withinLimit(limit)
        returns (address[] memory ct, address[] memory ds)
    {
        Pair[] storage _assets = swapAssets[Pair(pa, ra).toId()];

        uint256 start = uint256(page) * uint256(limit);
        uint256 end = start + uint256(limit);
@--1>        uint256 arrLen = end - start;

        //@audit arrlen
        if (end > _assets.length) {
@--2>            end = _assets.length;
        }

        if (start > _assets.length) {
            return (ct, ds);
        }

        //@audit2 
        ct = new address[](arrLen);
        ds = new address[](arrLen);

        for (uint256 i = start; i < end; i++) {
            ct[i - start] = _assets[i].pair0;
            ds[i - start] = _assets[i].pair1;
        }
    }
```

from the @audit2 tag we can tell that the size of ct and ds array is determined by `arrayLen`, However `end` is used to loop through ct and ds when initializing assets. But whenever `@--2` validates true, the end value changes meaning, the end is shorter than previous that is less items will be looped through but the arrayLen is not updated causing it to be out of sync. 

for example 
start = 10
end = 10+10 = 20
arrLen = 20-10 =10
assets.length = 15 
(20>15) end=15
(10>15) continue

ct =  10 members
ds = 10 members

(i=10; i<15; i++){}

from the example we see that the for loop only initialises 5 members but the arrays has size of 10 memebers

### Mitigation

Update `arrLen` after `if (end > idx)`
