# The absence of slippage protection can result in users receiving fewer tokens than expected when removing liquidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a comment above the call that says: `amountAMin & amountBMin = 0 for 100% tolerance`. Indeed, the absence of slippage protection provides 100% tolerance to avoid DOS when removing liquidity, and also opens the door to front-running attacks that result in users receiving less funds than they expect.

## Impact
Users receiving less funds than they expect.

## Tool used
