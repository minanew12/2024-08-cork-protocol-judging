# Malicious user can deny adding liquidity to the pool.

## Summary
In newly created pair of CT and RA with zero liquidity a malicious user can manually transfer 1 wei of assets and call ``sync()`` to block liquidity addition until someone manually transfers CT into the pool. 
 
## Vulnerability Detail
The uniswap addLiquidity function is used in the protocol to add liquidity to an RA + CT amm pair anytime a user deposits in Vault or there is remaining fee in psm and vault calculation.
``.addLiquidity()`` internally calls ``_addLiquidity()``
```Solidity
    function _addLiquidity(
        address tokenA,
        address tokenB,
        uint amountADesired,
        uint amountBDesired,
        uint amountAMin,
        uint amountBMin
    ) private returns (uint amountA, uint amountB) {
        // create the pair if it doesn't exist yet
        if (IUniswapV2Factory(factory).getPair(tokenA, tokenB) == address(0)) {
            IUniswapV2Factory(factory).createPair(tokenA, tokenB);
        }
        (uint reserveA, uint reserveB) = UniswapV2Library.getReserves(factory, tokenA, tokenB);
        if (reserveA == 0 && reserveB == 0) {
            (amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBDesired);
        } else {
            uint amountBOptimal = UniswapV2Library.quote(amountADesired, reserveA, reserveB);
            if (amountBOptimal <= amountBDesired) {
                require(amountBOptimal >= amountBMin, 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_B_AMOUNT');
                (amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBOptimal);
            } else {
                uint amountAOptimal = UniswapV2Library.quote(amountBDesired, reserveB, reserveA);
                assert(amountAOptimal <= amountADesired);
                require(amountAOptimal >= amountAMin, 'UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_A_AMOUNT');
                (amountA, amountB) = (amountAOptimal, amountBDesired);
            }
        }
    }
```
If liquidity in pair is 0, the function takes whatever the ratio is provided. However, if pair has existing liquidity, the function proceeds to calculate optimal amount using ``quote()``
```Solidity
   function quote(uint amountA, uint reserveA, uint reserveB) internal pure returns (uint amountB) {
        require(amountA > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_AMOUNT');
        require(reserveA > 0 && reserveB > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');
        amountB = amountA.mul(reserveB) / reserveA;
    }
```
Notice the second require condition here that wants both of the token reserves to be non-zero. 
Now, suppose a malicious user manually transfers 1wei worth of RA and calls ``sync()`` in UniswapV2Pair.sol
```Solidity
  function sync() external lock {
        _update(IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)), IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)), reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```
```Solidity
    function _update(uint balance0, uint balance1, uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) private {
        require(balance0 <= uint112(-1) && balance1 <= uint112(-1), 'UniswapV2: OVERFLOW');
        uint32 blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp % 2**32);
        uint32 timeElapsed = blockTimestamp - blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
        if (timeElapsed > 0 && _reserve0 != 0 && _reserve1 != 0) {
            // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired
            price0CumulativeLast += uint(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve1).uqdiv(_reserve0)) * timeElapsed;
            price1CumulativeLast += uint(UQ112x112.encode(_reserve0).uqdiv(_reserve1)) * timeElapsed;
        }
        reserve0 = uint112(balance0);
        reserve1 = uint112(balance1);
        blockTimestampLast = blockTimestamp;
        emit Sync(reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```
This will update RA as 1 and CT as 0  as reserve values,  because they are using balanceOf here. 
Now, whenever ``addLiquidity`` is called, the ``_addLiquidity()`` function will proceed with quote since liquidity is there. Consequently, the require statement will revert since reserves should be greater than zero. 

This can only be fixed until someone manually transfers CT into the pair to make reserve as non-zero. 
Do protocol cannot add liquidity by calling ``.addLiquidity()``

## Impact
This could not have caused any problems if pair creation was a rare event. However given the fact that there could be multiple RA's for which ``issueNewDs`` is called everytime after expiry, this issue could have a combined effect over various initialized pools and manually transferring tokens to those pools can be a huge task. Also, this could also disincentivize user to add liquidity to vault causing a whole lot of problems in the entire model, this should be considered as High

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The only mitigation of this issue that I could think of is to not let an idle pool with zero liquidity. First liquidity should be immediately added by owner after pair creation.
