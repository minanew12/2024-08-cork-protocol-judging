# Improper use of transferFrom may lead to asset transfer failures leading to loss to the protocol.

### Summary

The improper use of the IERC20.transferFrom without verifying their return values will cause potential asset transfer failures to the protocol its self, as it assumes success of asset transfer to the protocol which was not. By not using OpenZeppelin’s safeTransferFrom, the protocol risks unexpected behavior and loss of asset to the protocol as it upsets the inetrnal account and could lead to lack of liquidity to the protocol.

### Root Cause

In PsmLib.sol, both IERC20.transferFrom is used without checking the return values. The protocol assumes successful transfers without considering the possibility of failure, which can happen as a matter of fact.

In the PsmLib.sol the _afterRedeemWithDs 

```solidity

```
does not verify the success of the token transfer from the user and afterwards does transfer pa assets to the users;

```solidity
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L344

```
This would lead of loss of both assets by the protocol which could lead to protocol solvency as well.

This is also the case in the _afterCtRedeem function as well:

```solidity

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L438

```
Also, successful transfer is always assumed as return values are not checked to ensure its not the case, it also sends pa assets to the users even if transferFrom silently fails. 
In _afterCtRedeem:

```solidity

```

### Internal pre-conditions

The user tries to redeem pa assets with ds, the transferFrom in the functions are invoked but fail silently, the protocol sends necessary redeeemed asset to user without checking if the transferFrom was indeed successful.

### External pre-conditions

The transferFrom operation had encountered an external condition, such as network congestion or specific behavior from the ERC20 token, causing it to silently fail or revert.

### Attack Path

The protocol interacts with a user that tries to redeem an asset for the other, meanwhile the token does not return true when transferFrom or transfer is called.

The protocol calls _afterRedeemWithDs or _afterCtRedeem, assuming the transfer succeeds without verifying it.

If the token silently fails the transfer (without reverting), the protocol does not catch this, and it may continue execution, thinking the transfer was successful and then sends assets to the user.

The user does in fact intiate the interaction fully understand that even if the transferFromm fails the transaction would not revert and they get the necessary from the protocol, leading to inconsistencies and potential loss of funds.

Standard-compliant ERC20 tokens may still have a minor chance of failure due to gas constraints or edge cases, leading to medium-to-high impact.

### Impact

The protocol’s state could be compromised, as it assumes transfers succeed even when they fail. This can result in incorrect balances, locked assets, or additional liability on the protocol to manually reconcile failed transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent this vulnerability and ensure transfers succeed, the protocol must be disciplined in its use of the OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 library including the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions. These functions verify the return value of the transfer and revert the transaction if the transfer fails, ensuring no silent failures occur.
