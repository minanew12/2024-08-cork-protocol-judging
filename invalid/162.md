# Attacker can manipulate reserves to buy an asset for a lower price.

## Summary
FlashSwapRouter.sol calculates amountOut based on reserves of the given pair, which can be manipulated by an attacker. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Relying on reserve ratio for asset price calculation can be tricked with a large trade/flashloan to get one of the assets in the pair for a cheaper price. It is especially true for UniV2 pools, which the current protocol uses. 

Consider an attacker who has acquired a large amount of Ds. He can call ```swapDsforRa``` first, do deplete RA reserves.  Then call ```swapRaforDs``` to acquire even more Ds.
