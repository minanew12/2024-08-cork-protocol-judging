# Lack of Access Control in `onNewIssuance` Function Allows Unauthorized Liquidity Manipulation and Forced LP Liquidation

## Summary
The `onNewIssuance` function in `VaultLibrary.sol` is marked as external without proper access control. As a result, any malicious actor can call this function directly, leading to potential unauthorized actions such as liquidity manipulation or liquidating LP positions. These actions could severely destabilize the protocol by allowing unauthorized minting, liquidity provisioning, or even triggering liquidations that could harm both users and the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the ModuleCore.sol contract, the function [issueNewDs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleCore.sol#L57) correctly uses the onlyConfig modifier to restrict access, ensuring only authorized parties can invoke the function. However, inside issueNewDs, the vulnerable [VaultLibrary.onNewIssuance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleCore.sol#L83) function is called, which is marked as external and lacks proper access control. This exposes the system to unauthorized actions, as any external party can directly call [onNewIssuance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L92), bypassing intended restrictions.

```solidity
function issueNewDs(Id id, uint256 expiry, uint256 exchangeRates, uint256 repurchaseFeePrecentage)
    external
    override
    onlyConfig
    onlyInitialized(id)
{
    // Function logic...
    VaultLibrary.onNewIssuance(state, prevIdx, getRouterCore(), getAmmRouter()); // External call
}
```

The `onNewIssuance()` function, when called, interacts with other critical functions like `_liquidateLp` and `__provideAmmLiquidityFromPool`, which can be exploited for unauthorized liquidity manipulation or liquidation of LP positions.


## Impact
A malicious actor could directly call the `onNewIssuance()` function, triggering `_liquidateLp` which allows a user to forcibly liquidate an LP position. This could lead to the premature liquidation of liquidity providers' positions, resulting in loss of assets for legitimate users and potentially causing a negative ripple effect in the liquidity pools.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function onNewIssuance(
        State storage self,
        uint256 prevDsId,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
    ) external {
        // do nothing at first issuance
        if (prevDsId == 0) {
            return;
        }

        if (!self.vault.lpLiquidated.get(prevDsId)) {
            _liquidatedLp(self, prevDsId, ammRouter, flashSwapRouter);
        }

        __provideAmmLiquidityFromPool(self, flashSwapRouter, self.ds[self.globalAssetIdx].ct, ammRouter);
    }
  ```
 Note: This poses a significant risk as it can trigger unauthorized actions such as `_liquidatedLp`, which liquidates liquidity providersâ€™ positions, or `_provideAmmLiquidityFromPool`, which affects liquidity provisioning.

## Recommendation
Add appropriate access control mechanisms to restrict access to the `onNewIssuance` function in VaultLibrary.sol
