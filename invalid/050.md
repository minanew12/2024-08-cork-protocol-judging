# type(uint256).max amount is not handled for special tokens in lockFrom function of RedemptionAssetManagerLib

### Summary

Some tokens like `cUSDCv3` has a special logic when the transfer amount is `type(uint256).max`. If a token of this type is called with the max amount, it will only transfer the amount of user's balance meaning the `type(uint256).max` is treated as the user's balance. However, this behavior is not correctly handled at `lockFrom` function causing the `locked` variable to get saturated.

### Root Cause

In [lockFrom](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/RedemptionAssetManagerLib.sol#L60) function of `RedemptionAssetManagerLib.sol` (and also the similar [lockFrom](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/LvAssetLib.sol#L53) function of `LvAssetLib.sol`) the case of `amount == type(uint256).max` is not handled, causing the `incLocked` function is called with `amount = type(uint256).max`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `cUSDCv3` token is used as the redemption token (moduleCore is initialized with `cUSDCv3` as the `ra` token).

### External pre-conditions

1. The redemption token is supporting max transfer logic as mentioned, like `cUSDCv3` token.

### Attack Path

1. Trudy who owns 1cUSDCv3 deposiPsm with `amount = type(uint256).max`

### Impact

The `locked` amount of `ra` token (`struct PsmRedemptionAssetManager`) will saturate to the max value causing no further lock is possible and as the result the function always reverts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Please, handle the `type(uint256).max` at `lockFrom` function:
```diff
    function lockFrom(PsmRedemptionAssetManager storage self, uint256 amount, address from) internal {
+       if(amount == type(uint256).max) {
+           amount = IERC20(self._address).balanceOf(from);
+       }
        incLocked(self, amount);
        lockUnchecked(self, amount, from);
    }
```
