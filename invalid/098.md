# CT tokens not getting burned leading to locking and pseudo increase in totalSupply

## Summary
A vulnerability in the function `VaultLib:_liquidatedLp` allows for the improper handling of excess `CT` (Cover Token) tokens that are converted to `RA` (Redemption Asset) and `PA` (Pegged Asset) without being burned. This could result in an unintended increase in the total supply of `CT` tokens, causing them to be locked in the protocol and potentially disrupting the token's economy.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `VaultLib:_liquidatedLp` is responsible for converting `LP` (Liquidity Pool), `DS` (Depeg Swap), `LV` (Liquidity Vault), and `CT` (Cover Token) tokens into `RA` (Redemption Asset) and `PA` (Pegged Asset). Here is the relevant portion of the code:

[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L349-L393)

Initially, the function removes liquidity from the Uniswap AMM by exchanging `lp` tokens for `ra` and `ct` tokens:
```solidity
(uint256 raAmm, uint256 ctAmm) = __liquidateUnchecked(
    self, self.info.pair1, self.ds[dsId].ct, ammRouter, IUniswapV2Pair(ds.ammPair), self.vault.config.lpBalance
);
```
Next, it retrieves the total `reservedDs` tokens:
```solidity
uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);
```
It then calculates the `redeemAmount`. If the `ds` (Depeg Swap) reserved tokens are greater than or equal to the `ct` tokens, the `redeemAmount` is set to the number of `ct` tokens. If `reservedDs` is less than `ct`, this means the number of `ds` tokens is insufficient, so `redeemAmount` is set to `reservedDs`:
```solidity
uint256 redeemAmount = reservedDs >= ctAmm ? ctAmm : reservedDs;
```
The `redeemAmount` amount of `ct` and `ds` tokens is then burned:
```solidity
PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(self, redeemAmount, dsId);
```
If there are excess `ct` tokens beyond the amount that can be paired with `ds`, the difference is calculated so that the excess `ct` tokens can be converted to `ra`:
```solidity
uint256 ctAttributedToPa = reservedDs >= ctAmm ? 0 : ctAmm - reservedDs;
```
The code checks if `ctAttributedToPa` is zero. If it is not zero, it calls the `PsmLibrary:lvRedeemRaPaWithCt()` function, passing the excess `ct` amount:
```solidity
(psmPa, psmRa) = PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaPaWithCt(self, ctAttributedToPa, dsId);
```
Within the `PsmLibrary:lvRedeemRaPaWithCt()` function, the excess `ct` amount is converted to `ra` and `pa`, and the resulting amounts are added to the user's balance.

### Vulnerability
The vulnerability is that the excess `ct` amount left over after conversion to `ra` and `pa` is never burned. If `ct` is not in excess, the process works correctly, and the `ct` and `ds` tokens are burned appropriately. However, if `ct` is in excess, the excess amount is converted to `ra` and `pa` without being burned, leading to a pseudo-increase in the total supply of `ct` tokens.

## Impact
Failing to burn the excess `ct` tokens results in:
- **Pseudo-Increase in Total Supply**: The `ct` tokens remain in circulation, artificially inflating the total supply, which could affect the token's value and economic balance.
- **Locked `CT` Tokens**: The excess `ct` tokens remain locked in the protocol, potentially reducing liquidity and causing unexpected behavior in token dynamics.

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix the vulnerability, ensure that any excess `ct` tokens are burned after their conversion to `ra` and `pa`. This could involve adding a burn step after the call to `PsmLibrary:lvRedeemRaPaWithCt()` to ensure that no unintended `ct` tokens remain in circulation. Additionally, consider implementing checks to verify that the total supply of `ct` remains consistent throughout the contract's operations.
