# `arrayLen` is outdated in `AssetFactory::getDeployedAssets`

### Summary

The `arrayLen` is not updated after or out-of-sync after the if statement changes the variables involved in computing the `arraylen` therefore resulting in a wrong arrLen

### Root Cause

[In line 69](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/assets/AssetFactory.sol#L69) we can find the initialisation of the arrayLen but whenever  `if (end > idx)` is satisfied the value of `end` changes making the arrayLen outdated but after there's no line that updates it

### Internal pre-conditions

1. When user calls getDeployedAssets 
2.  `if (end > idx)` must be satisfied or true

### External pre-conditions

No pre-condtions

### Attack Path

1. call `getDeployedAssets` 
2. Make sure `if (end > idx)` is true

### Impact

The arrayLen becomes outdated and resulting in longer arrays for `ra` and `lv` which will have empty slots because arrLen>end

### PoC

in the `AssetFactory::getDeployedAssets` code below

```soldity
function getDeployedAssets(uint8 page, uint8 limit)
        external
        view
        override
        withinLimit(limit)
        returns (address[] memory ra, address[] memory lv)
    {
        uint256 start = uint256(page) * uint256(limit);
        uint256 end = start + uint256(limit);
@1-->        uint256 arrLen = end - start;

        //@audit arrLen must be updated after this
        if (end > idx) {
@2-->            end = idx;
        }

        if (start > idx) {
            return (ra, lv);
        }

        //@audit 
        ra = new address[](arrLen);
        lv = new address[](arrLen);

        for (uint256 i = start; i < end; i++) {
            Pair storage asset = pairs[i];
            uint8 _idx = uint8(i - start);

            ra[_idx] = asset.pair1;
            lv[_idx] = lvs[asset.toId()];
        }
    }
```

from the @1 tag we can see the length of the array is initialized by subtracting two variables that are already declared i.e end & start.
However, when execution continues, at the audit tag we will see that there's an if statement that when true, changes the end value making it shorter according to the logic.
This means that the `arrLen` will change but after that we do not see any line of code updating the length thereby making the value outdated & wrong. As a result this will always make the `arrLen` larger than needed    

### Mitigation

  Update `arrLen` after `if (end > idx)`
