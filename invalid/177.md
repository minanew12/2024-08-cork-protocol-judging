# Public Access to provideLiquidityWithFee Function Allows Unauthorized Liquidity Manipulation

## Summary
The `provideLiquidityWithFee` function in the contract is intended to be called only through certain specific mechanisms (psm, flash swap router, and early redeem LV), as mentioned in the developer notes. However, since the function is marked as public, it can be called by anyone, potentially leading to unauthorized liquidity provisioning.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises because the function [provideLiquidityWithFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L602), which should only be called by specific components like psm, flash swap router, and early redeem LV, is defined as public. This means that any external user or contract can directly interact with this function and potentially manipulate the liquidity provisioning process.

## Impact
The lack of access control on the provideLiquidityWithFee function could allow unauthorized users to call the function, leading to manipulation of the liquidity provisioning process. This could negatively impact the protocol by disrupting the intended behavior of liquidity management.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// IMPORTANT : only psm, flash swap router and early redeem LV can call this function
function provideLiquidityWithFee(
    State storage self,
    uint256 amount,
    IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
    IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
) public {
    __provideLiquidityWithRatio(self, amount, flashSwapRouter, self.ds[self.globalAssetIdx].ct, ammRouter);
}
```

## Recommendation
Consider changing the function's visibility from public to internal or private if it is only meant to be called internally by specific functions.
