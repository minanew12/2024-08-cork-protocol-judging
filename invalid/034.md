# Implementation contracts doesn't include constructor with `_disableInitializers()` allowing impl contract to be initialized by attacker

### Summary

Many implementation contracts (in-scope) that doesn't include proper measures will cause initializing for all the intended upgradable contracts as an attacker will directly call `initialize` on implementation contract. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L9

In `AssetFactory.sol` and `FlashSwapRouter.sol` both the contracts are intended to be upgradeable via UUPS pattern, but has this issue.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Implementation contracts should inherit `UUPSUpgradeable` OZ contract. 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- The EOA attacker can directly call `initialize()` on the implementation contract instead of the native way via `delegatecall` using proxy contract. 
- This allows the EOA to become the `owner` of the implementation contract allowing them to execute restricted functions guarded with `onlyOwner ` modifier .

### Impact

 This allows the EOA to become the `owner` of the implementation contract allowing them to execute restricted functions guarded with `onlyOwner ` modifier .

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include the below snippet in the upgradeable contracts :
```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
   _disableInitializers();
}
```
