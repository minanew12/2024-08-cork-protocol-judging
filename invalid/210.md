# ERC20 approve is front-run able.

## Summary
1. The current implementation of erc20 approve introduces a front-running vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Usually if the uint256 value amount that is being approved is a tad larger than the available / existing approval then a front-runner transaction is said to cause a double spent edge case.
2. The vulnerability is the same than this one found in sherlock's surge audit: [finding](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge-judging/issues/154)

## Impact
1. The total approval spent will occasionally disregard expectation or will tend to be inconsistent with the expected approval spending in total.
