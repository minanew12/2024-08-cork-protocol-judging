# Anyone can frontrun permit call making swapRaforDs to revert

### Summary

The [`swapRaforDs` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L150-L162) on FlashSwapRouter.sol allow users to swap tokens in one call. To do so, it uses the permit function implemented in some ERC20 tokens. The issue is the same explained in this article: https://www.trust-security.xyz/post/permission-denied

### Root Cause

Any malicious user seeing the permit signature in the `swapRaforDs` function call can front run it by intercepting this signature and calls the `permit()` function of the ERC20 token contract before. Then, because the signature has already been used, the initial permit call from the contract will revert. There is no mechanism to prevent this in the code.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User calls `swapRaforDs()` with a valid permit signature (rawRaPermitSig) for the ERC20 token.
2. The attacker must obtain the permit signature before the user transaction is mined. It can be done via a public mempool.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls the `swapRaforDs()` function and submits a valid `rawRaPermitSig` signature for token approval.
2. The attacker intercepts this signature and calls the `permit()` function of the ERC20 token contract before the user transaction.
3. When the user's transaction is processed, the `permit()` function inside `swapRaforDs()` fails because the permit was already used, causing the transaction to revert.

### Impact

The users of Cork Protocol will suffer from a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, preventing them from executing the `swapRaforDs()` function. The attacker does not gain monetary rewards but can continuously grief users by DoS this function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `try/catch` keywords can be use in case of reverting, allowing to make the transaction if approval is enough. A library fixing it is provided here: https://github.com/trust1995/trustlessPermit/blob/main/TrustlessPermit.sol
