# Psm.sol :: previewRedeemRaWithDs() does not subtract the fee, resulting in users receiving a smaller amount than expected when they call redeemRaWithDs().

### Summary

**`previewRedeemRaWithDs()`** is intended to show the amount of RA tokens redeemed for DS tokens. However, the issue with this function is that it does not account for the **`psmBaseRedemptionFeePercentage`**. As a result, when users use **`previewRedeemRaWithDs()`** to estimate the RA they will receive, they may find that the actual amount received from **`redeemRaWithDs()`** is less by the fee amount.

**`previewRedeemRaWithDs()`** is implemented as follows.
```Solidity
function previewRedeemRaWithDs(Id id, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount)
        external
        view
        override
        onlyInitialized(id)
        PSMWithdrawalNotPaused(id)
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        State storage state = states[id];
        assets = state.previewRedeemWithDs(dsId, amount);
    }
```
This invokes **`previewRedeemWithDs()`**.
```Solidity
function previewRedeemWithDs(State storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        Guard.safeBeforeExpired(ds);

        uint256 normalizedRateAmount = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, ds.exchangeRate());

        assets = normalizedRateAmount;
    }
```
As you can see, it only calculates the amount using **`calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate()`** and does not subtract the **`psmBaseRedemptionFeePercentage`**.

On the other hand, **`redeemWithDs()`** which is used to redeem RA does subtract this fee.
```Solidity
function redeemRaWithDs(Id id, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount)
        external
        override
        nonReentrant
        onlyInitialized(id)
        PSMWithdrawalNotPaused(id)
    {
        State storage state = states[id];
        // gas savings
@>      uint256 feePrecentage = psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage;

        (uint256 received, uint256 _exchangeRate, uint256 fee) =
            state.redeemWithDs(_msgSender(), amount, dsId, bytes(""), 0, feePrecentage);

        VaultLibrary.provideLiquidityWithFee(state, fee, getRouterCore(), getAmmRouter());

        emit DsRedeemed(id, dsId, _msgSender(), amount, received, _exchangeRate, feePrecentage, fee);
    }
```
As demonstrated, **`psmBaseRedemptionFeePercentage`** is applied specifically in [_afterRedeemWithDs()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L329-L347), where the amount received is reduced by the fee ([received = -fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L342))

This discrepancy leads to users expecting to receive a certain amount, only to end up with less than anticipated.

### Root Cause

In [PsmLib.sol:previewRedeemWithDs()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L384-L395), the **`psmBaseRedemptionFeePercentage`** is not subtracted from the amount users will actually receive. As a result, users may expect to receive more RA tokens during redemption, but in reality, they will receive less.

### Internal pre-conditions

Nan.

### External pre-conditions

Nan.

### Attack Path

There is no attack vector involved; rather, this is a coding error. Users who call **`previewRedeemWithDs()`** will see an inflated token amount compared to what they actually receive.

### Impact

Users will expect to receive more RA tokens than they actually do. This discrepancy leads to a loss of funds, as the **`previewRedeemWithDs()`** does not accurately reflect the reduced amount. If users were aware of this shortfall in advance, they might choose to keep their tokens in the protocol rather than redeeming them.

### PoC

To run the POC, copy the following code into **`PsmCore.ts`**.
```Solidity
it("Different values in redeemRaWithDs and previewRedeemRaWithDs", async function () {

      //preview Redeem
      // just to buffer
      const deadline = BigInt(helper.expiry(expiryTime));

      pa.write.approve([fixture.moduleCore.address, parseEther("10")]);

      // 1 RA
      const rates = parseEther("1");

      //create new asset
      const { dsId, ds, ct } = await issueNewSwapAssets(
        helper.nowTimestampInSeconds() + 1000,
        { rates: rates }
      );
      const depositAmount = parseEther("10");
      const expectedAMount = parseEther("10");

      await fixture.moduleCore.write.depositPsm([fixture.Id, depositAmount], {
        account: defaultSigner.account,
      });

      const event1 = await fixture.moduleCore.getEvents.PsmDeposited({
        depositor: defaultSigner.account.address,
      });

      const raReceivedPreview = await fixture.moduleCore.read.previewRedeemRaWithDs([
        fixture.Id,
        dsId!,
        expectedAMount,
      ]);

      console.log("Preview:", raReceivedPreview);
      expect(raReceivedPreview).to.equal(depositAmount);

      //Real redeem
      pa.write.approve([fixture.moduleCore.address, parseEther("10")]);

      await fixture.moduleCore.write.depositPsm([fixture.Id, parseEther("10")]);

      const depositEvents = await fixture.moduleCore.getEvents.PsmDeposited({
        Id: fixture.Id,
        dsId,
        depositor: defaultSigner.account.address,
      });

      expect(depositEvents.length).to.equal(1);

      // prepare pa
      await fixture.pa.write.mint([defaultSigner.account.address, mintAmount]);

      await fixture.pa.write.approve([fixture.moduleCore.address, mintAmount]);

      const dsContract = await hre.viem.getContractAt("ERC20", ds!);
      await dsContract.write.approve([
        fixture.moduleCore.address,
        parseEther("10"),
      ]);

      await fixture.moduleCore.write.redeemRaWithDs([
        fixture.Id,
        dsId!,
        parseEther("10"),
      ]);

      const event2 = await fixture.moduleCore.getEvents.DsRedeemed({
        dsId: dsId,
        Id: fixture.Id,
        redeemer: defaultSigner.account.address,
      });

      expect(event2.length).to.equal(1);

      const eventArgs = event2[0].args;
      const receivedAmount = eventArgs.received;
      const fee = eventArgs.fee;

      console.log("Real:", receivedAmount);

      //RESULTS
      
      //real received amount and previwed amount are not the same
      expect(receivedAmount).not.equal(raReceivedPreview);
      //to be the same needs to add fee
      expect(receivedAmount + fee).to.equal(raReceivedPreview);
    });
```
As shown in the results, the obtained value differs from the expected amount, which is incorrect. Specifically, the discrepancy is due to the fee.

### Mitigation

To resolve the issue, subtract the **`psmBaseRedemptionFeePercentage`** in **`previewRedeemRaWithDs()`** in the same way it is done in **`redeemRaWithDs()`**.

Psm.sol
```diff
function previewRedeemRaWithDs(Id id, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount)
        external
        view
        override
        onlyInitialized(id)
        PSMWithdrawalNotPaused(id)
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        State storage state = states[id];
+       uint256 feePrecentage = psmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage;

-       assets = state.previewRedeemWithDs(dsId, amount);
+       assets = state.previewRedeemWithDs(dsId, amount, feePrecentage);

    }
```
PsmLib.sol
```diff
-function previewRedeemWithDs(State storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount)
+function previewRedeemWithDs(State storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount, uint256 feePrecentage)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        Guard.safeBeforeExpired(ds);

        uint256 normalizedRateAmount = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, ds.exchangeRate());
        
+       fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(normalizedRateAmount , feePrecentage);
+       normalizedRateAmount -= fee;

        assets = normalizedRateAmount;
    }
```
