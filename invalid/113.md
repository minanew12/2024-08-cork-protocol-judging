# M - 1 Uniswap callback is not protected

## Summary

Callback functions in Uniswap v2 or v3 are critical security points and require robust protection. Without proper safeguards, malicious actors can exploit these callbacks to manipulate contract states, drain funds, or execute unauthorized operations.

To ensure security, each callback must implement rigorous validation to confirm that the call originated from a legitimate Uniswap pool. This validation should include checking the msg.sender against known pool addresses and verifying transaction parameters.

Implementing these security measures is essential to prevent potential attacks from external owned accounts (EOAs) or malicious contracts attempting to exploit the callback function. Proper protection of callbacks is a fundamental aspect of maintaining the integrity and security of DeFi protocols interacting with Uniswap.
