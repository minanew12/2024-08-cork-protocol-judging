# Users can not cancel redemption requests which will lead to stuck `lv` for them and forces them to wait for expiry, getting `Ra` and `Pa` instead and taking a loss

### Summary

The `Vault` does not implement the function of the [VaultLib::cancelRedemptionRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L238), which means users can not cancel their requests and get `lv` tokens back. Thus, their funds would be lock until expiry and they could take losses if the value of `lv` decreases in the mean time, as they will be forced to redeem for `Ra` and `Pa` at expiry.

### Root Cause

The [Vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Vault.sol#L15) is missing the ability for users to cancel their requests, which as per the code which is the source of truth indicates it should have this function as it is implemented in the `VaultLib`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User wants to cancel their redemption request but can not.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls [Vault::requestRedemption()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Vault.sol#L69).
2. User wants to cancel the redemption request but can not.

### Impact

User is DoSed until expiry and takes a loss if the `lv` loses value in the mean time considering the exchange rate at expiry to `Ra` and `Pa`.

### PoC

Check the `Vault` contract to confirm that the function is not implemented, but is present in the `VaultLib`.

### Mitigation

Implement the `cancelRedemptionRequest()` function in the `Vault`.
