# Precision Loss in convertToLp Function Leads to Undervalued LP Token Liquidation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/MathHelper.sol#L195

in function `convertToLp`

```solidity
function convertToLp(uint256 rateRaPerLv, uint256 rateRaPerLp, uint256 redeemedLv)
    external
    pure
    returns (uint256 lpLiquidated)
{
    lpLiquidated = ((redeemedLv * rateRaPerLv) * 1e18) / rateRaPerLp / 1e18;
}
```

The bug in this function is related to precision loss due to integer division. This function is used to calculate the amount of LP tokens to be liquidated based on the amount of LV tokens being redeemed. The bug can lead to underestimation of the LP tokens to be liquidated, potentially causing a loss of value for users.

Here's why this is problematic:

1. The function first multiplies `redeemedLv` by `rateRaPerLv`, which is correct.

2. It then multiplies the result by 1e18, presumably to add precision.

3. it then divides by `rateRaPerLp` and immediately after by 1e18.

4. This order of operations can lead to precision loss because the division by `rateRaPerLp` might result in a value less than 1e18, which when divided by 1e18 again, could round down to zero or a significantly smaller value than intended.

The impact on the project could be significant:

1. Users redeeming LV tokens might receive fewer LP tokens than they should, leading to a loss of value.
2. This could affect the overall liquidity in the system, as fewer LP tokens are being liquidated than should be.
3. It could create an imbalance in the protocol's economics, potentially benefiting some parties (like the protocol itself) at the expense of users.

A more precise approach would be to perform the multiplications first, then do the divisions, and use a higher precision factor. For example:

```solidity
function convertToLp(uint256 rateRaPerLv, uint256 rateRaPerLp, uint256 redeemedLv)
    external
    pure
    returns (uint256 lpLiquidated)
{
    lpLiquidated = (redeemedLv * rateRaPerLv * 1e36) / (rateRaPerLp * 1e18);
}
```

This version maintains higher precision throughout the calculation and should provide a more accurate result. 

This bug could have significant implications for the Cork Protocol, especially in functions that rely on this calculation for liquidations or redemptions, potentially affecting the protocol's stability and user trust.

This function is called during early redemption of LV tokens, which is a critical operation in the Cork Protocol.

While the precision loss in `convertToLp` is a real concern, it's important to consider :

1. The function is using 18 decimal precision (1e18), which is standard for many ERC20 tokens and provides a good level of accuracy for most operations.

2. The precision loss would only be significant if `rateRaPerLp` is much larger than `rateRaPerLv`

### Impact:

The main impact would be that users redeeming LV tokens early might receive less value than they should. This could lead to a loss of funds for users and potentially create an arbitrage opportunity that could be exploited.

PoC Flow:

1. Assume the following values:
   - `rateRaPerLv` = 1e18 (1 RA per LV)
   - `rateRaPerLp` = 1e20 (100 RA per LP)
   - `redeemedLv` = 1e20 (100 LV tokens)

2. Using the current `convertToLp` function:
   ```solidity
   lpLiquidated = ((1e20 * 1e18) * 1e18) / 1e20 / 1e18
                = (1e38 * 1e18) / 1e20 / 1e18
                = 1e36 / 1e20
                = 1e16 (0.01 LP tokens)
   ```

4. Using a more precise calculation:
   ```solidity
   lpLiquidated = (1e20 * 1e18) / 1e20
                = 1e18 (1 LP token)
   ```

5. The difference is significant: 0.01 LP tokens vs 1 LP token. This means the user would receive 100 times less value than they should.

6. An attacker could potentially exploit this by:
   a. Waiting for conditions where `rateRaPerLp` is much larger than `rateRaPerLv`
   b. Performing early redemptions to benefit from the undervalued LP liquidation
   c. Immediately providing liquidity again to profit from the difference


### Mitigation 


A more precise approach would be to perform the multiplications first, then do the divisions, and use a higher precision factor. For example:

```solidity
function convertToLp(uint256 rateRaPerLv, uint256 rateRaPerLp, uint256 redeemedLv)
    external
    pure
    returns (uint256 lpLiquidated)
{
    lpLiquidated = (redeemedLv * rateRaPerLv * 1e36) / (rateRaPerLp * 1e18);
}
```
