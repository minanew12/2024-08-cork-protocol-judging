# [H-05] Unchecked Token Transfer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
What is the Unchecked Token Transfer vulnerability?
In Ethereum, the ERC-20 standard is commonly implemented for fungible tokens, which are often used for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The standard specifies a core method, transfer(), which per the specification must return a Boolean value indicating whether or not the transfer succeeded. While the specification indicates that transfers that would fail due to insufficient funds should throw an error, this is not a strict requirement. If DeFi or other projects perform token transfers in this manner without checking this return value, they may silently fail to send tokens to intended recipients.

Technical example of vulnerable code
For this example, let us consider two separate files. First, we have a file defining an ERC-20 token that does not throw an error on transfers that would fail:

Performing an ERC-20 token transfer without checking the result may result in silent token transfer failures.

Recommendation: Always check the retun value from token transfer functions where available.
