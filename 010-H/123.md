# stagnated PA Is Locked Forever

## Summary

When reserving RA and PA after liquidating LP , it is calculated that how much of the RA  and PA is associated for withdrawals and how much for AMM. The amount calculated for PA for withdrawals is used the redeeming but the stagnated PA amount is not accounted anywhere and is stuck in the contract forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Consider when we reserve the RA and PA we get when we liquidate the LP ->

2.) In the reserve() function , for the PA amount we divide the PA amount like ->

```solidity
      uint256 totalPa = self.withdrawalPool.paBalance + addedPa;
        (attributedToWithdraw, attributedToAmm, ratePerLv) =
            MathHelper.separateLiquidity(totalPa, totalLvIssued, totalLvWithdrawn);

        self.withdrawalPool.paBalance = attributedToWithdraw;
        self.withdrawalPool.stagnatedPaBalance = attributedToWithdraw;
        self.withdrawalPool.paExchangeRate = ratePerLv;
```

3.) We can see that the `paBalance` is being used for redeems , but the `stagnatedPaBalance` amount of PA is never being touched , 
it is stuck in the contract forever.


## Impact

Stagnated amount of PA is stuck , this amount should be given back to the LV holders.
