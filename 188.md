# Using `MKR` as the `RA` or `PA` will be impossible even though it should be supported, breaking the readme

### Summary

$MKR returns a `bytes32` variable for the [name](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2#readContract), which will revert when a `Ra`, `Pa` pair is created using $MKR in [AssetFactory::deploySwapAssets()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/assets/AssetFactory.sol#L155).

In the readme it is [stated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate):
> Standard ERC-20 tokens with 18 decimals are supported

As per EIP20, returning a name variable with a string is [optional](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-20.md#name):
> OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

So the contract incorrectly assumes the `Ra` or `Pa` asset will have the `name()` function returning a string, breaking the `EIP20` which clearly states contracts should not assume this function will be present.

### Root Cause

In `AssetFactory:155` and `AssetFactory:183`, `name()` is called on the `Ra` or `Pa`, which reverts for $MKR.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

1. $MKR is used as a `Ra` or `Pa` asset.

### Attack Path

1. Admin tries to deploy a pair which includes $MKR but it reverts.

### Impact

The protocol is not fully `EIP20` compliant, breaking the readme.
$MKR can not be used as an `Ra` or `Pa`.

### PoC

`AssetFactory::deploySwapAssets()`:
```solidity
function deploySwapAssets(address ra, address pa, address owner, uint256 expiry, uint256 psmExchangeRate)
    external
    override
    onlyOwner
    notDelegated
    returns (address ct, address ds)
{
    ...
    string memory pairname = string(abi.encodePacked(Asset(ra).name(), "-", Asset(pa).name())); //@audit MKR
    ...
}
```

### Mitigation

Use a try catch to fetch the name or send the name as argument.
