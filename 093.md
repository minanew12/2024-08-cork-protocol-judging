# [H-03] Same Named Contracts

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

What is the Same Named Contracts vulnerability?
For a single compilation unit, reused contract names will cause errors in the Solidity compiler. Some frameworks may attempt to mask these errors and will only compile certain contracts as a result. To avoid such difficulties and simplify code, names should not be reused and should follow the guidelines in the Solidity documentation.

Further reading: Solidity Documentation: Contract and Library Names
Olympix: When multiple contracts with the same name exist in the same codebase, only one may be compiled.
