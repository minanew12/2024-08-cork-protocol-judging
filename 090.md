# [M-03] Faulty Division Operation

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

What is the Faulty Division Operation vulnerability?
While newer versions of the Solidity language support fixed-point mathematical operations, many calculations in Ethereum (including for units of ether itself) are done using integer arithmetic. This means that any division operation has the potential to lead to imprecise results in cases where the inputs are variable. Rounding errors may ultimately lead to unintended calculations and even exploits of smart contract logic as a result.

A real-world example: Midas Capital
On June 18, 2023, the Midas Capital protocol was exploited due to a bug in a redemption calculation that used imprecise division. An attacker was able to use the manner in which the calculations were made to subvert the intent of the protocol and redeem more tokens than they were entitled to, resulting in an approximate loss of $600,000.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


Olympix: Division operation at L134:C21 precedes multiplication operations at the following locations:
    - /Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/MathHelper.sol L141:C32

Recommendation: Always perform integer multiplication before division where possible.
