2.) But this is not implemented in the Vault contract ->

3.) This means that users don't have the option to cancel their redemption request  ,there might exist a  usecase for LV token that requires it to be locked somewhere, by requesting redemption, you lock your LV token in the vault and it's important to let user decide if they want to keep requesting redemption or cancel it, rather than just locking user token with no choice for them to cancel it (Dev confirmed).

## Impact

Users don't have the option to cancel their redemption request
