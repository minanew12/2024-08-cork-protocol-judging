# user cannot cancel his redemption request

### Summary

from our `vault.sol` we can see that there's no function implementing the `cancelRedemptionRequest` in the main vault contract thereby making it impossible for external users to cancel their redemption request whenever they place one.

### Root Cause

Main vault contract doesn't implement [`cancelRedemptionRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L238) from the vaultLib contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

No pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

No pre-conditions

### Attack Path

No attack path because there is no function to interact with.

### Impact

Whenever user request redemption they can't cancel it or undo their actions. 

### PoC

in  [`vaultLib.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Vault.sol#L15) we can find this function 
`function cancelRedemptionRequest(State storage self, address owner, uint256 amount) external {`

but when you look into the main contract `vault.sol` that the user interacts with, you won't find `cancelRedemptionRequest` making it impossible for users to cancel their redemption request because they can't interact with `vaultLib`.


### Mitigation

implement some logic to help users cancel redemption request like implementing `cancelRedemptionRequest` in the main vault contract.
