# Redemtion request can not be cancelled

## Summary
The function VaultLib::cancelRedemptionRequest` can not be called and that makes cancelling a redemption request a user submitted impossible.

## Vulnerability Detail
Once the user requests redemption via `Vault::requestRedemption` there is no way to cancel the redemption. The function to cancel the redemption is present in `VaultLib::cancelRedemptionRequest` however, since this is a library function, it is not exposed as part of the smart contract by default. The `Vault` doesn't provide a way to call this function.

## Impact
Users who create a redemption request expect it to be cancellable before expiry. This is impossible in the current implementation.

## Recommendation
Expose a function to cancel the redemption request via `Vault`.
