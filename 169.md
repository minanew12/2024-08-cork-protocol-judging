# User can manipulate initial RA/CT AMM price, causing significant loss to the protocol and other users

### Summary

Lack of protocol-controlled initial liquidity provision will cause a significant vulnerability for the protocol and other users as a malicious user can set an arbitrary initial price in the RA/CT AMM pool, leading to incorrect protocol liquidity provision and arbitrage opportunities.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors in the protocol's design and implementation:

1. Lack of Mandatory Protocol-First Liquidity Provision on first issuance:
In the VaultLibrary, the onNewIssuance function doesn't provide initial liquidity for the first issuance:

```solidity
function onNewIssuance(
    State storage self,
    uint256 prevDsId,
    IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
    IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
) external {
    // do nothing at first issuance
    if (prevDsId == 0) {
        return;
    }
    // ...
}
```
This allows a user to be the first liquidity provider, setting an arbitrary initial price.

2. Reliance on AMM Price After Initial Liquidity:

In the __getAmmCtPriceRatio function:

```solidity
function __getAmmCtPriceRatio(State storage self, IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter, uint256 dsId)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 ratio)
{
    ratio = self.ds[dsId].exchangeRate() - self.vault.initialDsPrice;

    try flashSwapRouter.getCurrentPriceRatio(self.info.toId(), dsId) returns (uint256, uint256 _ctRatio) {
        ratio = _ctRatio;
    } catch {}
}

function getPriceRatio(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 raPriceRatio, uint256 ctPriceRatio)
{
    AssetPair storage asset = self.ds[dsId];

    address token0 = asset.pair.token0();
    address token1 = asset.pair.token1();

    (uint112 token0Reserve, uint112 token1Reserve,) = self.ds[dsId].pair.getReserves();

    (uint112 raReserve, uint112 ctReserve) = MinimalUniswapV2Library.reverseSortWithAmount112(
        token0, token1, address(asset.ra), address(asset.ct), token0Reserve, token1Reserve
    );

    (raPriceRatio, ctPriceRatio) = SwapperMathLibrary.getPriceRatioUniv2(raReserve, ctReserve);
}
```
 Once initial liquidity is provided, the function uses the AMM's price ratio for all liquidity additions. This allows a manipulated initial price to propagate through the system.

3. Unrestricted Initial AMM Liquidity Provision:
The protocol doesn't restrict who can provide the initial liquidity to the AMM pair as v2-periphery contracts show no such mechanism.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. First Issuance for a RA/PA

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Immediately after issuance of a new RA/PA, Attacker calls deposit function in the PSM, providing RA.
2. Attacker receives equivalent amounts of CT and DS based on the correct exchangeRate.
3. Attacker immediately calls the AMM's addLiquidity function, providing CT and RA at an arbitrary ratio, setting an incorrect initial price.
4. Attacker deposits RA into the Liquidity Vault (LV) and/or waits for other users to deposit RA into the LV.
5. The protocol adds liquidity to the AMM using the LV deposit, but at the incorrect price set by the attacker.
6. Attacker arbitrages between the PSM (at the correct rate) and the AMM (at the incorrect rate), extracting value from the system.

### Impact

The protocol suffers significant losses as it provides liquidity at an incorrect price, at a huge deviation from intended initial price. Other users are affected by distorted prices. The attacker gains substantial profits from arbitrage between the PSM and AMM.
