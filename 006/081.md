# Incorrect Reserve Calculation Due to Misuse of LP Supply Parameter in Liquidity Vault.

Here's the filled and updated version:

---

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in the way the Liquidity Vault (`LV`) calculates reserves in the `VaultLib` functions. The issue stems from using the wrong variable for the Liquidity Provider (LP) token supply, which results in incorrect calculations of reserve asset (`RA`) and counter token (`CT`) values. This miscalculation could allow an attacker to exploit the pool, leading to significant financial losses.

## Vulnerability Detail

The sequence of function calls is as follows:  
`Vault:redeemEarlyLv()` → `VaultLib:redeemEarly()` → `_liquidateLpPartial()` → `__calculateCtBalanceWithRate(self, flashSwapRouter, dsId)` → `__calculateTotalRaAndCtBalanceWithReserve()`

The critical function is `__calculateTotalRaAndCtBalanceWithReserve()`, which is intended to compute various balances and values based on the total LP token supply (`lpSupply`):

```solidity
function __calculateTotalRaAndCtBalanceWithReserve(
    State storage self,
    uint256 raReserve,
    uint256 ctReserve,
    uint256 lpSupply
)
    internal
    view
    returns (
        uint256 totalRa,
        uint256 ammCtBalance,
        uint256 raPerLv,
        uint256 ctPerLv,
        uint256 raPerLp,
        uint256 ctPerLp
    )
{
    (raPerLv, ctPerLv, raPerLp, ctPerLp, totalRa, ammCtBalance) = MathHelper.calculateLvValueFromUniV2Lp(
        lpSupply, self.vault.config.lpBalance, raReserve, ctReserve, Asset(self.vault.lv._address).totalSupply()
    );
}
```

However, the fourth parameter, which should be `lpSupply`, is incorrectly provided by `__calculateCtBalanceWithRate()` as the return value of `flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId)`:

```solidity
(,, raPerLv, ctPerLv, raPerLp, ctPerLp) = __calculateTotalRaAndCtBalanceWithReserve(
    self, raReserve, ctReserve, flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId)
);
```

Examining the `flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve()` function reveals that it does not return the `lpSupply`. Instead, it returns the reserve of the `ds` token:

```solidity
function getLvReserve(Id id, uint256 dsId) external view override returns (uint256 lvReserve) {
    return reserves[id].ds[dsId].reserve;
}
```

The natspec documentation for the `AssetPair` struct confirms that this value represents the amount of `DS` held in reserve by the Liquidity Vault:

```solidity
struct AssetPair {
    Asset ra;
    Asset ct;
    Asset ds;
    /// @dev [RA, CT]
    IUniswapV2Pair pair;
    /// @dev this represent the amount of DS that the LV has in reserve   <==
    /// will be used to fulfill buy DS orders based on the LV DS selling strategy <==
    // (i.e., 50:50 for the first expiry, and 80:20 on subsequent expiries. note that it's represented as LV:AMM) <==
    uint256 reserve;
}
```

For further clarity, the issue can be observed in the `VaultLib:__liquidateUnchecked()` function, where `lp` tokens are sent to the AMM pair, and the `lpBalance` variable is updated accordingly:

```solidity
self.vault.config.lpBalance -= lp;
```

Similarly, in `VaultLib:_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()`, the function incorrectly fetches the amount of `DS` tokens using the same execution path as the one used for fetching the `lpSupply`:

```solidity
uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);
```

## Impact

The incorrect fetching of the `lpSupply` results in miscalculations of `RA` and `CT` balances. This discrepancy allows an attacker to exploit the pool by manipulating the `DS` reserve. Since the `lp` pool token is derived from the `DS` token, an attacker could mint additional `DS` tokens, falsely inflate their reserves, and claim more assets (`RA` and `CT`) than they are entitled to. This could cause severe financial losses to the pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The function `__calculateTotalRaAndCtBalanceWithReserve()` should be passed the correct `lpSupply` value. Ensure that the parameter represents the actual supply of LP tokens rather than the `DS` reserve amount. Modify the call to `flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve()` to fetch the appropriate value or provide a direct means to obtain the correct LP token supply within the function's logic.
