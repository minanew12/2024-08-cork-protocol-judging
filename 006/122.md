# While Redeeming Early User Might Receive Way Lesser RA Than Expected

## Summary

Users can redeem their LV early , this partially liquidates the LP and RA is received but this RA received can be way lesser than anticipated.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) User tries to redeemEarly with an amount of LV tokens ->

2.) These LV tokens are used for partial liquidation ->

3.) raPerLv , raPerLP , ctPerLp are calculated using `__calculateCtBalanceWithRate` ->

```solidity
 function __calculateCtBalanceWithRate(State storage self, IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter, uint256 dsId)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 raPerLv, uint256 ctPerLv, uint256 raPerLp, uint256 ctPerLp)
    {
        (uint256 raReserve, uint256 ctReserve,) = flashSwapRouter.getUniV2pair(self.info.toId(), dsId).getReserves();

        (,, raPerLv, ctPerLv, raPerLp, ctPerLp) = __calculateTotalRaAndCtBalanceWithReserve(
            self, raReserve, ctReserve, flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId)
        );
    }
```

We can see these values depend on the AMM reserves. Lesser reserves on the AMM means lesser value per LP/LV . Therefore a big trade (some redeemed early a huge amount or reduced liquidity on the AMM) can effect the RA amount that's returned and it can be way lesser due to high slippage.

## Impact

User will experience huge slippage and get way lesser RA than anticipated for his LV tokens , the user will experience a loss for his deposits.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow the user to mention a minimum slippage tolerance when redeeming early.
