# [H-06] Reentrancy

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

What is the Reentrancy vulnerability?
In Ethereum, program logic encoded in smart contracts is capable of calling logic in separate contracts, which may be authored by separate entities. This aspect of the system's design leaves open the possibility that chains of function calls may ultimately invoke a function that was already called earlier in the chain, "re-entering" its body. Depending on what statements in the body of the re-entered function follow the departure point where it originally invoked an external contract, the execution logic may differ from what the developer intended, and may lead to serious issues with overall smart contract execution.

More concretely, functions in Ethereum that make external calls (which could ultimately re-enter that same function), and subsequently modify some state in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), may lead to executions where state is inconsistent, because the original function never completed its state modifications before being re-entered. Note that it is possible that these state modifications may be "remote" from the original function rather than inline statements, as long as they are reachable after the external call.

Modifying state after making an external call may allow for reentrancy attacks.

## Recommendation

Recommendation: Avoid making changes to state variables in a function after an external call, where possible.
