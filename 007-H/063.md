# `MathHelper::calculatePrecentageFee` is called with the wrong argument order, leading to incorrect calculation of fees

### Summary

The function `MathHelper::calculatePrecentageFee` is called by `PsmLib::previewRepurchase`, `PsmLib::_afterRedeemWithDs`, `VaultLib::redeemEarly` and `VaultLib::previewRedeemEarly` and in all of these functions, the parameters are called incorrectly. The `calculatePrecentageFee` first takes in the fees and then the amount. In the functions mentioned above these two parameters are switched.

### Root Cause

In `PsmLib` and `VaultLib` the functions that call `MathHelper::calculatePrecentageFee` all pass its' parameters incorrectly. The first parameter that should be passed is the fee and the second one is the amount, however, they are passed in the wrong order.

### Internal pre-conditions

No Internal pre-conditions.

### External pre-conditions

No External pre-conditions.

### Attack Path

1. One of the following functions is being called leading to incorrect calculation of fees: 
`PsmLib::previewRepurchase`, `PsmLib::_afterRedeemWithDs`, `VaultLib::redeemEarly` and `VaultLib::previewRedeemEarly`

### Impact

Wrong fee calculations could cause users to pay too much or too little. This might make users lose trust in the system and could be used to unfairly profit from the mistake. It could harm the overall financial health of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Pass the parameters in the following order:

`PsmLib::previewRepurchase`

```diff
function previewRepurchase(State storage self, uint256 amount)
    {
       ...code
-        fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(amount, feePrecentage);
+       fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(feePrecentage, amount);
        ...code
    }
```

`PsmLib::_afterRedeemWithDs`

```diff
function _afterRedeemWithDs( 
        State storage self,
        DepegSwap storage ds,
        address owner,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 feePrecentage)
    {
       ...code
-        fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(received, feePrecentage);
+       fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(feePrecentage, received);
        ...code
    }
```

`VaultLib::redeemEarly`

```diff
function redeemEarly() {
        ...code
-      fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(received, feePrecentage);
+     fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(feePrecentage, received);
        ...code
}
```

`VaultLib::redeemEarly`

```diff
function previewRedeemEarly() {
        ...code
-      fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(received, feePrecentage);
+     fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(feePrecentage, received);
        ...code
}
```
