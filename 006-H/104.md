# FlashSwapRouter.emptyReserve() always returns 0 leading to excess DS in the LV to be stucked

## Summary

The Liquidity Vault holds DS tokens, which are paired with CT tokens during LP liquidation to mint RA. The vault tracks these DS tokens internally and attempts to utilize all available DS when the current DS expires. However, the current implementation of the `emptyReserve()` function is flawed, as it is expected to return the amount of DS tokens removed during the operation. Instead, it incorrectly returns the amount of DS tokens remaining, which leads to improper accounting and prevents the vault from fully utilizing the DS tokens as intended.
## Vulnerability Detail

In `VaultLib.sol` in `_liquidatedLp()` function, the following line is used to get the available DS tokens:
`uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);`

In `FlashSwapRouter.sol`:
```solidity
...
using DsFlashSwaplibrary for ReserveState;
...
function emptyReserve(Id reserveId, uint256 dsId) external override onlyOwner returns (uint256 amount) {
        amount = reserves[reserveId].emptyReserve(dsId, owner());
        emit ReserveEmptied(reserveId, dsId, amount);
}
```

In `DsFlashSwap.sol`:
```solidity
function emptyReserve(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, address to) internal returns (uint256 reserve) {
        reserve = emptyReservePartial(self, dsId, self.ds[dsId].reserve, to);
}
```

```solidity
function emptyReservePartial(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount, address to)
        internal
        returns (uint256 reserve)
    {
        self.ds[dsId].ds.transfer(to, amount);

        self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount;
        reserve = self.ds[dsId].reserve;
    }
```

`emptyReservePartial()` returns the amount left in the reserve and in case we remove all, the result will always be 0.
## Impact

Unavailability to use the excess DS token in the LV can lead to less rewards for user who want to redeem their part of the vault.  Combined with the high likelihood of this scenario happening, this should be considered as a High severity issue.

## Recommendation

Update `emptyReserve()` to save the amount before removing it and use it as a return value:
```diff
function emptyReserve(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, address to) internal returns (uint256 reserve) {
+		reserve = self.ds[dsId].reserve;
+       emptyReservePartial(self, dsId, self.ds[dsId].reserve, to);
-       reserve = emptyReservePartial(self, dsId, self.ds[dsId].reserve, to);
}
```
