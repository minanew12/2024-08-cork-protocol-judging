# `FlashSwapRouter.sol` proxy contract cannot be initialized

## Summary
The notDelegated modifier in the initialize function in the FlashSwapRouter.sol contract prevents the proxy contract from being initialized. This means that the contract can not be used as it was intended, i.e. as an upgradeable contract to be called via an EIP-1967 proxy.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `FlashSwapRouter.sol`  contract implements OpenZeppelin's UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard). It serves as the implementation contract which should be called by an EIP-1967 proxy using delegatecall. This means that contract initialization should happen also via delegatecall and state changes should happen on the proxy contract's state. However, in the AssetFactory.sol contract this is impossible because of the notDelegated modifier.

## Impact
The contract is unusable, this leads to a severe distruption to the workings of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the notDelegated modifier from the initalize function to allow the proxy contract to be initialized.
