# `notDelegated` modifier prevents `AssetFactory::deploySwapAssets` and `AssetFactory::deployLv` to be used

## Summary
`AssetFactory.sol` is a UUPSUpgradeable implementation contract that should be used via an ERC-1967 proxy. However, the `notDelegated` modifier prevents the `deploySwapAssets` and `deployLv` functions to be called via the proxy.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `AssetFactory.sol` contract implements OpenZeppelin's UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard). It serves as the implementation contract which should be called by an ERC-1967 proxy using `delegatecall`. The `notDelegated` modifier prevents the `deploySwapAssets` and `deployLv` functions to be called via the proxy, and thus makes core functionalities of the protocol unusable.

## Impact
New swap assets (Depeg Swap and Cover Token) and new liquidity vault tokens cannot be deployed. This is a severe limitation to the functioning of the protocol.
