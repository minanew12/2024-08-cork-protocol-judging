# Upgradeable contract `FlashSwapRouter.sol` cannot be upgraded

## Summary
it is impossible to upgrade the `FlashSwapRouter.sol` contract. This smart contract is a UUPS upgradeable contract, however because the overriden _authorizeUpgrade function contains the notDelegated modifier, it can not be upgraded.

## Vulnerability Detail
_authorizeUpgrade is overridden as below:
```solidity
   function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner notDelegated {}
```
However, this UUPSUpgradeable OpenZeppelin smart contract only allows upgrades via a proxy:
```solidity
function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) public payable virtual onlyProxy {...}
```
This inconsistency means it is impossible to upgrade the contract.

## Impact
This means if the protocol team later wants to update the implementation they are unable to do so, and they are stuck with the current implementation forever.
