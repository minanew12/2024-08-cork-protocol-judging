# Incorrect implementation of Uniswap V2 library function

## Summary
The uniswap library contract
``
MinimalUniswapV2Library::getAmountOut()
``
incorrectly implements 

## Vulnerability Detail
The uniswap library contract
``
MinimalUniswapV2Library::getAmountOut()
``
incorrectly implements the token calculation function which incorrectly calculates the amount of tokens to receive from the user or give to the user which is different from the actual tokens that the user would receive and the vault that keeps track, the amm would be returning different amount of tokens to the user 


## Impact
The Impact will be incorrectly as even though the asset values assumed by the protocol maybe same the uniswap pool treats it based on the pool reserve and maintains the ``x*y = k`` formula so the calculation done using the library is different than the actual result 

-> DsFlashSwap uses this library functionality  


## Code Snippet
``libraries::UniswapV2Library::getAmountOut()`` is the function that has the issue 
```solidity
function getAmountOut(uint256 amountIn, uint256 reserveIn, uint256 reserveOut)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256 amountOut)
   {
               require(amountIn > 0, "UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_INPUT_AMOUNT");
               require(reserveIn > 0 && reserveOut > 0, "UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY");
               uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * NO_FEE;
               uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee * reserveOut;
        
              // @audit not done as specified in the uniswap v2 docs
  @>>      uint256 denominator = reserveIn * 1000;
                amountOut = numerator / denominator;
    }
```
