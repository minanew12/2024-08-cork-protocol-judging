# Lack of Pausability for the `Psm.sol#repurchase()` function.

## Summary
This limited implementation of the pause function potentially compromises the safety of the protocol assets by exposing critical operations in emergency situations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol's main functions are protected by the pausability functionality, which ensures the safety of assets in emergency situations, and this is implemented by the `CorkConfig.sol#updatePoolsStatus()` function.
- `CorkConfig.sol#updatePoolsStatus()`:
```solidity
/**
     * @notice Updates pausing status of PSM and LV pools
     * @param id id of PSM
     * @param isPSMDepositPaused new value of isPSMDepositPaused
     * @param isPSMWithdrawalPaused new value of isPSMWithdrawalPaused
     * @param isLVDepositPaused new value of isLVDepositPaused
     * @param isLVWithdrawalPaused new value of isLVWithdrawalPaused
     */
    function updatePoolsStatus(
        Id id,
        bool isPSMDepositPaused,
        bool isPSMWithdrawalPaused,
        bool isLVDepositPaused,
        bool isLVWithdrawalPaused
    ) external onlyManager {
        moduleCore.updatePoolsStatus(
            id, isPSMDepositPaused, isPSMWithdrawalPaused, isLVDepositPaused, isLVWithdrawalPaused
        );
    }
```

- Modifiers:
```solidity
    modifier PSMDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
        if (states[id].psm.isDepositPaused) {
            revert PSMDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
    }

    SNIP...

    modifier PSMWithdrawalNotPaused(Id id) {
        if (states[id].psm.isWithdrawalPaused) {
            revert PSMWithdrawalPaused();
        }
        _;
    }

    modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
        if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
            revert LVDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
    }

    modifier LVWithdrawalNotPaused(Id id) {
        if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
            revert LVWithdrawalPaused();
        }
        _;
    }
```
As you can see, the pausability mechanism for the `Psm.sol#repurchase()` function is not implemented.
Also, the function itself does not implement any protection mechanism.
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice repurchase using RA
     * @param id the id of PSM
     * @param amount the amount of RA to use
     */
    function repurchase(Id id, uint256 amount) external override {
        State storage state = states[id];
        (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 feePrecentage, uint256 fee, uint256 exchangeRates) =
            state.repurchase(_msgSender(), amount, getRouterCore(), getAmmRouter());

        emit Repurchased(id, _msgSender(), dsId, amount, received, feePrecentage, fee, exchangeRates);
    }
```
The `Psm.sol#repurchase()` is a main feature of the protocol is that the peg stabilization module can repurchase the pegged assets + defeg swap tokens received during the redemption period, thereby facilitating potential arbitrage.

## Impact
The lack of comprehensive pause functionality exposes the contract to potential problems when it needs to be paused for maintenance or in response to an attack. If all non-migration features are not restricted during a pause, users can interact with the contract in unintended ways while it is paused. This means that in the event of an emergency (e.g. a security vulnerability is discovered), the contract cannot be fully paused to protect funds and prevent unauthorized transactions.

If the vulnerability is exploited before a fix is ​​applied, protocol assets can be lost.

Since pauses are a common safeguard to mitigate damage in the event of an incident, this increases the risk to user assets.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement a pause protection mechanism in the `Psm.sol#repurchase()` function.
