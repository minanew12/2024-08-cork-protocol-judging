# Psm.sol: `repurchase` function is missing modifier to pause function

### Summary

All other functions inside of the [PSM.sol(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol) are restricted by modifiers so the protocol can pause them. This modifier is missing form the repurchase function allowing users to always call this function.

### Root Cause

The function [repurchase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L34-L40) is missing a modifier and can always be called, even if deposits are disabled to e.g. protect the protocol or users. This can lead user or protocol tokens being at risk.
