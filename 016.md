# An attacker will exploit some of the liquidity pools because two pools can be created for a given PA-RA pair.

### Summary

`ModuleCore::getId` takes PA and RA addresses in this order as shown below, and returns the corresponding Id.
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleCore.sol#L33

If the order is reversed `ModuleCore::getId` returns a different Id. However, `ModuleState::underlyingAsset` reverses these addresses, mixing up the asset addresses in the process.

Multiple liquidity vaults, cover tokens and depeg swap tokens will be created if Admin intiallize the new Id. This causes liquidity fragmentations. Low liquidity in one of the pools makes it vulnerable to price and oracle manipulation attack and eventual loss of funds.

### Root Cause

1. `ModuleState::underlyingAsset` mixes up RA and PA addresses
2. `ModuleCore::getId` not returning the same Id if the PA-RA addresses are reversed

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin initialize the reverse pair id because the reverse pair has a different unintialized Id. Then, new liquidity vaults, cover tokens and depeg swap tokens are created for the existing PA-RA pair.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

 An attacker can perform the following actions in 2 transactions to exploit the protocol;
1. Take a flashloan from other platforms in RA and deposit it in `PSM` to get CT+DS.
2. With high amount of CT, buy RA from the low-liquidity AMM (UniswapV2) pool. This will cause the price of CT to tank relative to RA. The attacker can pay back the flashloan now.
3. While that is ongoing, he can take a second flashloan, again in RA, then buy large amount of CT at a very low price from the same AMM pool.
4. Now the attacker has a large amount of CT and DS (from step 1) with which he can exploit the protocol. 
5. At this point, he can use all the DS + some CT to redeem RA to payback the flashloan.
6. Then, wait for the CT price in the AMM pool to normalize. He can now swap the excess CT for RA in the AMM pool or redeem more RA and PA from `PSM`.

### Impact

This will lead to liquidity fragmentations as multiple RA-CT AMM pools would be created for the same PA-RA pair. Unusually low liquidity in one of the pools makes it vulnerable to price and oracle manipulation attack. An attacker can steal funds in a liquidity pool.

### PoC

Please copy the code below in to the ModuleCore.ts file and run the test.

```javascript
 it(" pa_address and ra_address mixed up and id of pa-ra is not equal to ra-pa e.g Id(USDe-USDC) != Id(USDC-USDe)", async function () {
      const Id_pa_ra = await moduleCore.read.getId([
        fixture.pa.address,
        fixture.ra.address,
      ]);
      const Id_ra_pa = await moduleCore.read.getId([
        fixture.ra.address, fixture.pa.address
      ]);
      expect(Id_pa_ra).not.to.equal(Id_ra_pa);
      // keyHash = hash([pa_address, ra_address])
      const keyHash = ethers.utils.keccak256(
        ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
          ["address", "address"],
          [fixture.pa.address, fixture.ra.address]
        )
      ) as `0x${string}`;
      let assets = await moduleCore.read.underlyingAsset([keyHash]);  // returns [ra_address, pa_address]
      // assets[0] != pa_address
      expect(assets[0].toUpperCase()).not.to.equal(
        fixture.pa.address.toUpperCase()
      );
      // assets[0] = ra_address
      expect(assets[0].toUpperCase()).to.equal(
        fixture.ra.address.toUpperCase()
      );
      // assets[1] != ra_address
      expect(assets[1].toUpperCase()).not.to.equal(
        fixture.ra.address.toUpperCase()
      );
      // assets[1] = pa_address
      expect(assets[1].toUpperCase()).to.equal(
        fixture.pa.address.toUpperCase()
      );
    });
```

### Mitigation

Refactor the `ModuleCore::getId` such that it returns the same hash value for a given PA-RA pair even when the addresses are reversed as shown below.

```javascript
    //  create a mapping
    mapping(Id =>bool) private idExists;
    function getId(address pa, address ra) external pure returns (Id) {
        Id newId1 = PairLibrary.initalize(pa, ra).toId();
        Id newId2 = PairLibrary.initalize(ra, pa).toId();
        if (idExists(newId1)){
            return newId1;
        } else if(idExists(newId2)){
            return newId2;
        }
        idExists(newId1) = true;
        return newId1;
    }
```
Refactor `ModuleState::underlyingAsset` as follows;
```diff
    function underlyingAsset(
        Id id
-   ) external view override returns (address ra, address pa) {
+   ) external view override returns (address pa, address ra) {
-       (ra, pa) = states[id].info.underlyingAsset();    
+       (pa, ra) = states[id].info.underlyingAsset();
    }
```
