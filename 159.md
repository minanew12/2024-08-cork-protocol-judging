# New Deposits Can Be Griefed

## Summary

Due to a condition in the UniV2 while adding liquidity , an attacker can take advantage and make new deposits revert . The users deposits would revert until assets are directly transferred in the pool and the expiry clock will keep ticking.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) This is how the `_addLiquidity` function is in UniV2 ->

https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L33-L58
 
2.) There are certain conditions in the above function , firstly it handles the case when there both reserves are 0 and will allow whatever ratio is provided , then in the next it calculates amountB based on provided amountA and the current reserve ratio and then in the next it calculates amountA based on provided amountB and the current reserve ratio.

3.) The quote function is as follows in UniV2 ->

```solidity
 function quote(uint amountA, uint reserveA, uint reserveB) internal pure returns (uint amountB) {
        require(amountA > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_AMOUNT');
        require(reserveA > 0 && reserveB > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');
        amountB = amountA.mul(reserveB) / reserveA;
    }
```

4.) For a newly created pair (created here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleCore.sol#L77 ) the attacker can do  ->

a.) Consider the pair has been newly created and no liquidity is there currently , now the attacker can send one wei of the other token in the pool manually and then invokes the `sync()` function ->

```solidity
 function sync() external lock {
        _update(IERC20(token0).balanceOf(address(this)), IERC20(token1).balanceOf(address(this)), reserve0, reserve1);
    }
```

Now , `reserveB` = 1 , means condition 1 will not be invoked now in the add liquidity (since one token has non 0 reserves) and enters the next condition which invokes the above `quote()` function , but the statement ` require(reserveA > 0 && reserveB > 0, 'UniswapV2Library: INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY');` would make the addition of liquidity revert , 

Therefore if someone in the vault was doing a deposit ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L204

the addition of liquidity into the AMM would revert making the whole deposit tx revert DoSing the system temporarily till someone manually transfers tokenA to the pair and invokes sync. Plus , the expiry time will keep ticking so it will be a DoS since deposits are only permitted before expiry.




## Impact

Deposits can be DoSed .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Manually transfer some assets into the pool and call sync on creation of pair.
