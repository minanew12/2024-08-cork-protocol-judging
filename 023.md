# Lack of Slippage Protection in `repurchase` Function Can Cause Financial Loss for Users

### Summary

The lack of a `minReceived` (for slippage protection) parameter in the [`repurchase` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L293-L322) will cause a potential financial loss for users as market volatility can lead to users receiving significantly fewer tokens than expected.

### Root Cause

In `Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol` the [`repurchase` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L293-L322) lacks a `minReceived` (for slippage protection)  parameter to protect against slippage. This affects the `Psm::repurchase` function


### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call [`Psm::repurchase` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L34-L40) with a specified amount of RA.
2. The [`PsmLib::previewRepurchase` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L302-L303)  calculates the received amount based on current market conditions.


### External pre-conditions

1. Market conditions change unfavorably during the transaction processing time.


### Attack Path

1. User calls [`repurchase` function in `PsmCore` contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L34-L40).
2. The `repurchase` function in `PsmLib` is executed without a `minReceived` parameter (slippage protection).
3. Market conditions change unfavorably, resulting in the user receiving fewer tokens than expected.


### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss due to receiving fewer tokens than expected because of market volatility.


### PoC

1. User calls `repurchase` function in `PsmCore` contract:
```solidity
File: Psm.sol
34:     function repurchase(Id id, uint256 amount) external override {
35:         State storage state = states[id];
36:         (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 feePrecentage, uint256 fee, uint256 exchangeRates) =
37:             state.repurchase(_msgSender(), amount, getRouterCore(), getAmmRouter());
38: 
39:         emit Repurchased(id, _msgSender(), dsId, amount, received, feePrecentage, fee, exchangeRates);
40:     }

```
2. The `repurchase` function in `PsmLib` is executed:
```solidity
File: PsmLib.sol
293:     function repurchase(
294:         State storage self,
295:         address buyer,
296:         uint256 amount,
297:         IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
298:         IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
299:     ) internal returns (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 feePrecentage, uint256 fee, uint256 exchangeRates) {
300:         DepegSwap storage ds;
301: 
302:         (dsId, received, feePrecentage, fee, exchangeRates, ds) = previewRepurchase(self, amount);
303: 
304:         // decrease PSM balance
305:         // we also include the fee here to separate the accumulated fee from the repurchase
306:         self.psm.balances.paBalance -= (received);
307:         self.psm.balances.dsBalance -= (received);
308: 
309:         // transfer user RA to the PSM/LV
310:         self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);
311: 
312:         // transfer user attrubuted DS + PA
313:         // PA
314:         (, address pa) = self.info.underlyingAsset();
315:         IERC20(pa).safeTransfer(buyer, received);
316: 
317:         // DS
318:         IERC20(ds._address).transfer(buyer, received);
319: 
320:         // Provide liquidity
321:         VaultLibrary.provideLiquidityWithFee(self, fee, flashSwapRouter, ammRouter);
322:     }

```
3. Market conditions change unfavorably, resulting in the user receiving fewer tokens than expected.


### Mitigation

Add a `minReceived` parameter (slippage protection) to the `repurchase` function to ensure users receive a minimum amount of tokens. If the received amount is less than `minReceived`, the transaction should revert.
