# Unrestricted `Burn` Function Allows Manipulation of Total Supply Leading to Critical Contract Failures and Potential Exploits



## Summary

The vulnerability lies in the unrestricted `burn` function for `lv` tokens, which allows anyone to burn these tokens without any checks or restrictions. This could lead to critical failures in the smart contract logic, particularly impacting the `totalLvIssued` variable used in various liquidity-related calculations. An attacker can exploit this by minting `lv` tokens with multiple accounts, then burning them to manipulate the `totalSupply` of `lv` tokens to 0, causing failures in liquidity calculations and potentially enabling further exploits.

## Vulnerability Detail

The execution flow leading to the vulnerability is as follows:
- `ModuleCore:issueNewDs` ➔ `VaultLibrary.onNewIssuance(..)` ➔ `VaultLib:onNewIssuance()` ➔ `_liquidatedLp()` ➔ `self.vault.pool.reserve(..)`

In the function `VaultLib:_liquidatedLp`, the following line is critical:
```solidity
self.vault.pool.reserve(self.vault.lv.totalIssued(), raAmm + psmRa, psmPa);
```
Here, `self.vault.lv.totalIssued()` represents the total supply of the `lv` tokens and is passed to the `VaultPoolLib:reserve()` function as the `totalLvIssued` parameter.

This `totalLvIssued` is subsequently used in the `MathHelper:separateLiquidity` function:
```solidity
(uint256 attributedToWithdraw, uint256 attributedToAmm, uint256 ratePerLv) =
    MathHelper.separateLiquidity(totalRa, totalLvIssued, totalLvWithdrawn);
```

Inside `MathHelper:separateLiquidity`, `totalLvIssued` is used as a divisor to calculate `ratePerLv`. 

The key issue here is that if `totalLvIssued` becomes `0`, this calculation will fail, causing a critical failure in the contract's execution. Since `totalLvIssued` is derived from the total supply of the `lv` token, the attacker can manipulate this by minting `lv` tokens across multiple accounts and then burning them to reduce the total supply to `0`.

### Exploitable Burn Function

The `lv` token contract's `burn` function is not restricted, meaning **anyone can call it at any time**. This allows an attacker to:
1. Deposit funds using multiple accounts to mint a large number of `lv` tokens.
2. Burn these tokens to reduce the total supply to `0`.
3. Trigger failures in any part of the contract logic that depends on `totalLvIssued`.

There are no checks or restrictions in the `burn` function to prevent this action, creating an opportunity for malicious actors to exploit the contract for personal gain or to disrupt its functionality in other ways.

## Impact

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By reducing `totalLvIssued` to `0`, attackers can cause critical calculations to fail, potentially freezing or breaking the entire contract system.
- **Manipulation of Liquidity Calculations:** Attackers could manipulate the contract’s internal liquidity metrics, leading to financial losses or unintended behaviors.
- **Potential Further Exploits:** The ability to set `totalLvIssued` to `0` could open the door to other vulnerabilities that rely on this value being non-zero.

## Tool Used

- Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. **Restrict the `burn` Function:** Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized entities can burn `lv` tokens. Alternatively, consider adding logic to prevent burning below a certain threshold.
2. **Implement Safeguards in Liquidity Calculations:** Add checks in the `MathHelper:separateLiquidity` function and other critical functions to ensure they handle edge cases, such as `totalLvIssued` being `0`, gracefully.
3. **Audit and Review for Further Implications:** Given the potential severity, conduct a thorough audit to identify any other parts of the contract that might be vulnerable to similar exploits.
