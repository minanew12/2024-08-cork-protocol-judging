# [H-02] abi.encodePacked with Dynamic Types

## Summary
Using abi.encodePacked() with more than one dynamic type argument can result in hash collisions.

## Vulnerability Detail


Recommendation: If you need to encode multiple dynamic types in a hash function, use abi.encode() instead.

What is the abi.encodePacked with Dynamic Types vulnerability?
The Solidity language offers a built-in capability for performing ABI-encoding and decoding of data. The function abi.encodePacked() will pack its argument data tightly, which means that it is possible for different sets of arguments to resolve to the same packed data. If the arguments are meant to be used as a way of selecting unique data, this may lead to collisions.

If there is a dynamic array, different structures but the same hash value may be obtained Due to conflicting hash values, signatures can be substituted for each other, making malicious use of illegal signatures possible
## Impact

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/assets/AssetFactory.sol#L155

If a hash collision occurs at AssetFactory.sol:155, it would result in the same swapAssets array being used for two different asset pairs. This means that CT and DS assets deployed for one pair would be mixed with those of another pair, leading to incorrect asset associations and potential mismanagement of funds. The system would fail to properly distinguish between different asset pairs, causing confusion in asset tracking and potentially allowing for unintended cross-pair interactions. This situation could be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the system's state and potentially gain unauthorized access to assets.

Having the same LV address for two vaults would lead to significant confusion. The system would be unable to distinguish between the two different asset pairs, resulting in mismanagement of assets. This could potentially compromise the entire system's integrity and functionality, leading to incorrect asset tracking and possible exploitation of the contract's operations.
