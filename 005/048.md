# Wrong handling of `reservedDs` leading wrong accounting and loss of funds



## Summary

The `emptyReservePartial` function in the `VaultLib.sol` library of the Cork protocol is incorrectly setting the reserve value to `0`, which causes an unexpected loss of assets and disrupts the core functionality of the protocol. This occurs due to incorrect handling of reserve values during the redemption process.

## Vulnerability Detail

The execution flow of the vulnerability is as follows:

1. **Function Call Sequence**: 
   - `Vault:redeemExpiredLv()` calls `state.redeemExpired`.
   - This in turn calls `_liquidatedLp(self, dsId, ammRouter, flashSwapRouter)`.
   - Then `flashSwapRouter.emptyReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId)` is called.
   - Inside this, `amount = reserves[reserveId].emptyReserve(dsId, owner())` is executed.
   - Finally, it calls `emptyReservePartial(self, dsId, self.ds[dsId].reserve, to)`.

2. **Incorrect Reserve Handling in `emptyReservePartial` Function**:
   - In the `emptyReservePartial` function, the `amount` passed is `self.ds[dsId].reserve`.

   ```solidity 
   function emptyReservePartial(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount, address to)
   internal
   returns (uint256 reserve)
   {
       self.ds[dsId].ds.transfer(to, amount);
       self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount;
       reserve = self.ds[dsId].reserve;
   }
   ```
   - Since `amount` is set to `self.ds[dsId].reserve`, the subtraction `self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount` results in `self.ds[dsId].reserve` always becoming `0`.
   - The returned `reserve` will also always be `0`, leading to the `reservedDs` being `0` as well.

3. **Effect on `reservedDs` Calculation**:
   - The expected value of `reservedDs` should be `self.ds[dsId].reserve` before the line `self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount`. However, since `emptyReservePartial` returns the remaining reserve after subtraction, `reservedDs` becomes `0`.
   - This makes the calculation for `redeemAmount` incorrect:
   ```solidity
   uint256 redeemAmount = reservedDs >= ctAmm ? ctAmm : reservedDs;
   ```
   - Since `reservedDs` is always `0`, `redeemAmount` will also be `0`.

4. **Impact on User Assets and Protocol Functionality**:
   - As a result, users may face significant losses due to the improper redemption process.
   - The core functionality of the protocol, particularly the redemption logic, is broken, causing a failure in the expected asset management and arbitrage mechanisms.

## Impact

- **Financial Loss**: Users will not receive the correct amount during redemption due to `redeemAmount` being incorrectly calculated as `0`.
- **Protocol Integrity**: The core functionality of the protocol's asset management and redemption is disrupted, potentially affecting the entire liquidity management mechanism.
- **Loss of Trust**: Users may lose confidence in the protocol due to unexpected losses and malfunctioning redemption processes.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L374

```solidity
function emptyReservePartial(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount, address to)
internal
returns (uint256 reserve)
{
    self.ds[dsId].ds.transfer(to, amount);
    self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount;
    reserve = self.ds[dsId].reserve;
}
```

The problematic line is:
```solidity
self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount;
```
which causes `self.ds[dsId].reserve` to always become `0`.

## Tool Used

- **Manual Review**

## Recommendation

- Modify the `emptyReservePartial` function to return the correct reserve value before subtracting the `amount`.
