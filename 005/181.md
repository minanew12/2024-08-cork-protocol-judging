# Incorrect value from emptyReservePartial may cause user redemption requests to be blocked in LV

### Summary

The incorrect return value from emptyReservePartial will cause a critical failure in the redemption process for LV users as the system will attempt to sell non-existent CT tokens, potentially blocking all redemptions.

### Root Cause

In RouterState contract for FlashSwapRouter the emptyReservePartial function returns the remaining reserve instead of the amount emptied, which is then misused in subsequent calculations:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L80

```solidity
function emptyReservePartial(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount, address to)
    internal
    returns (uint256 reserve)
{
    self.ds[dsId].ds.transfer(to, amount);
    self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount;
    reserve = self.ds[dsId].reserve; // Returns remaining reserve
}
```
This return value is then used incorrectly in _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt:
```solidity
function _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt(
    State storage self,
    uint256 dsId,
    IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
    IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
    uint256 ammCtBalance
) internal returns (uint256 ra) {
    uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);
    uint256 redeemAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? ammCtBalance : reservedDs;
    reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReservePartial(self.info.toId(), dsId, redeemAmount);
    ra += redeemAmount;
    PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(self, redeemAmount, dsId);
    uint256 ctSellAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? 0 : ammCtBalance - reservedDs;
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The initial reservedDs needs to be greater than or equal to ammCtBalance
2. The emptyReservePartial function needs to empty most or all of the reserve, leaving a remaining amount less than ammCtBalance

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User initiates a redemption request in the LV
2. The system calculates the redeemAmount as ammCtBalance (since reservedDs >= ammCtBalance)
3. emptyReservePartial is called, emptying the reserve and returning the remaining amount
4. The returned value (remaining reserve) is stored in reservedDs
5. The system calculates ctSellAmount as a non-zero value (since the new reservedDs < ammCtBalance)
6. The system attempts to sell this non-existent CT amount, causing the transaction to revert

### Impact

The LV users cannot execute their redemption requests. This could potentially block all redemptions under certain conditions, leading to locked funds and a loss of trust in the protocol. The inability to redeem may cause a loss of funds for users, as exchange rates and other market conditions may change unfavorably before the issue is resolved, potentially reducing the value of their assets when they are finally able to redeem.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify emptyReservePartial to return both the emptied amount and the remaining reserve and modify the use accordingly.
