# emptyReserve Returns 0 Instead Of The Total Reserves

## Summary

When liquidating LP , the entire LP balance is liquidated (removeLiquidity on Uniswap) which returns us CT and RA , the next step is to
empty out the entire DS reserve and pair it up with CT  (to redeem RA) , but when emptying up the DS reserve the value returned is 0 therefore no RA is redeemed in this process.


## Vulnerability Detail

1.) When the DS is expired the LP is liquidated ,

2.) What happens in this function is ->

a.) The AMM LP is redeemed to receive CT + RA
b.) Any excess DS in the LV is paired with CT to redeem RA
c.) The excess CT is used to claim RA + PA in the PSM

The excess DS is paired with CT received from AMM to redeem RA , this is how it's done ->

`uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);`

3.) This is the `emptyReserve` function in the flash swap router ->

```solidity
function emptyReserve(Id reserveId, uint256 dsId) external override onlyOwner returns (uint256 amount) {
        amount = reserves[reserveId].emptyReserve(dsId, owner());
        emit ReserveEmptied(reserveId, dsId, amount);
    }
```

```solidity
function emptyReserve(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, address to) internal returns (uint256 reserve) {
        reserve = emptyReservePartial(self, dsId, self.ds[dsId].reserve, to);
    }

    function emptyReservePartial(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount, address to)
        internal
        returns (uint256 reserve)
    {
        self.ds[dsId].ds.transfer(to, amount);

        self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount;
        reserve = self.ds[dsId].reserve;
    }
```

As you can see , in the emptyReserve the amount passed is `self.ds[dsId].reserve`  , therefore the returned amount of reserve would be 
0 (`self.ds[dsId].reserve -= amount` would be 0 and reserve is returned as `self.ds[dsId].reserve`)

4.) Therefore all the DS reserves would be left untouched , and then all of the CT received from the AMM would be used to redeem RA + PA ,therefore incorrect  RA + PA would be redeemed and DS is not burnt meaning the supply remains same and untouched in the reserve(burning is essential to maintain the fact the fact that if CT increases in value DS decreases in value and vice versa).


## Impact

Incorrect RA redemptions due to reserve DS returned as 0 instead of the reserve amount , DS will be left as it is untouched and no RA redemptions would be made with it.

## Recommendation

Return the total reserve amount instead of returning reserve after deducting the total reserves.
