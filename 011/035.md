# Hardcoded slippage may prevent the users from providing liquidity

 ## Summary
Hardcoded slippage may prevent users from providing liquidity during periods of high volatility

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, when providing liquidity, the slippage (tolerance) the `MathHelper.UNIV2_STATIC_TOLERANCE` variable is used. It is set to 1% which may not be enough during period of high volatility. This could make depositing to the Liquidity Vault impossible in a period of high volatility
## Impact
Users are unable to deposit because of the slippage calculation

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the users to be able to overwrite the default/hardcoded slippage, to ensure that they can transact even during times of high volatility.
