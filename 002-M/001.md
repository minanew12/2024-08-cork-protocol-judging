# VaultCore::depositLv and previewLvDeposit functions will not work as expected due to incorrect implementation of Modifier

### Summary

The logic of `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier condition is incorrectly implemented. In the vault configuration, the pausing of deposits and withdrawals is independently tracked.

```solidity
   struct VaultConfig {
    // 1 % = 1e18
    uint256 fee;
    uint256 lpBalance;
 ==>    bool isDepositPaused;
 ==>    bool isWithdrawalPaused;
}
```

The `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier incorrectly refers to `isWithdrawalPaused` bool instead of `isDepositPaused` bool in the below modifier.  Due to this, while withdrawals are paused, the depositing functionality is also paused while it is not intended to be paused.


```solidity
    modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
        if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
            revert LVDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
    }
```

### Root Cause

In `ModuleState.sol`, the logic implementation is incorrect. When the withdrawals are paused, the functions that have the `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier will also be paused.

As the above modifier is attached to `depositLv(...)` function and `previewLvDeposit(...)` function, on pausing the withdrawals, both of these functions related to deposit will stop functioning.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Pause withdrawals by calling the below function with `isLVWithdrawalPaused` set to true.

```solidity
     function updatePoolsStatus(
        State storage self,
        bool isPSMDepositPaused,
        bool isPSMWithdrawalPaused,
        bool isLVDepositPaused,
  ===>      bool isLVWithdrawalPaused
    ) internal {
        self.psm.isDepositPaused = isPSMDepositPaused;
        self.psm.isWithdrawalPaused = isPSMWithdrawalPaused;
        self.vault.config.isDepositPaused = isLVDepositPaused;
 ===>       self.vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused = isLVWithdrawalPaused;
    }
```

2.  call `depositLv()` or `previewLvDeposit()` and it should revert.

### Mitigation

Revise the `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier as below to resolve the issue. The pause should be applicable only if `isDepositPaused` is set to true for the id.

```solidity
   modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
   -    if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
   +    if (states[id].vault.config.isDepositPaused) {
            revert LVDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
    }
```
