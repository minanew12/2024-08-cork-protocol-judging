# Result of transfer / transferFrom not checked in LvAssetLibrary

### Summary

A call to transferFrom or transfer is done without checking the results. For certain ERC20 tokens, if insufficient tokens are present, no revert occurs but a result of "false" is returned. So its important to check this. If you don't you could mint tokens without have received sufficient tokens to do so. So you could loose funds.

Its also a best practice to check this. See below for example where the result isn't checked.

### Root Cause

In `LvAssetLibrary.sol`, in the `unlockTo()` and `lockUnchecked()` functions, while moving ERC20 tokens across accounts, the return value for the transfer is n

Another similar example is in `DsFlashSwap` contract

`DsFlashSwap.sol::emptyReservePartial()`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incase there are no sufficient tokens or approvals to perform the transfer, the function returns a flag to indicate the failure of the underlying transaction.

But, if the return value is being ignored, then the protocol will incorrectly account the transfer and proceed resulting in breaking of accounting system of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The recommended is to use safe transfer functions like being used in `RedemptionAssetManagerLibrary`

```solidity
   function unlockTo(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount, address to) internal {
        decLocked(self, amount);
 -      self.asErc20().transfer(to, amount);// @audit use safe transfer
 +     self.asErc20().safetransfer(to, amount);// @audit use safe transfer
    }

    function lockUnchecked(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount, address from) internal {
-     ERC20(self._address).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);// @audit use safe transfer
+    ERC20(self._address).safetransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);// @audit use safe transfer
    }
```
