# There is neither a fee collector nor a fee sweep mechanism in place

## Summary

There are mechanisms in place to charge fees to users; however, without a fee collector or a fee sweep mechanism, the protocol can't take these fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users redeem `RA` using `DS + PA` or repurchase `DS + PA` with `RA`, certain fees are deducted and directed to the Uniswap V2 pool in the name of the `ModuleCore` contract. Additionally, the same process occurs when users redeem `lv` before expiry. The `lp` tokens from the Uniswap V2 pool corresponding to these fees are held by the `ModuleCore` contract rather than any fee collector. Furthermore, there is no function within the contract to sweep these fees.

```solidity
Psm.sol

    function redeemRaWithDs(Id id, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount, bytes memory rawDsPermitSig, uint256 deadline)
        ...

137     VaultLibrary.provideLiquidityWithFee(state, fee, getRouterCore(), getAmmRouter());
        ...

----------------------------

PsmLib.sol

    function repurchase(
        ...

321     VaultLibrary.provideLiquidityWithFee(self, fee, flashSwapRouter, ammRouter);
        ...

----------------------------

VaultLib.sol

    function redeemEarly(
        ...

660     provideLiquidityWithFee(self, fee, flashSwapRouter, ammRouter);
        ...
```

## Impact

The protocol can't take fees.

## Recommendation

There should be a fee sweep function.
