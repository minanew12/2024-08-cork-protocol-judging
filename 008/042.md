# Unprotected transaction timing in Uniswap V2 integration enables price manipulation and MEV attacks

## Summary

Unprotected transaction timing in Uniswap integration enables price manipulation and MEV attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `VaultLib.__addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked()`, `VaultLib.__liquidateUnchecked()` and `VaultLibrary._redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()` functions incorrectly use the `block.timestamp` as the `deadline` parameter when interacting with the Uniswap V2 Router. This practice undermines the security measure intended by the `deadline` parameter and exposes users to potential exploitation.

[VaultLib.sol#L74-L76](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L74-L76)
```solidity
(,, uint256 lp) = ammRouter.addLiquidity(
    token0, token1, token0Amount, token1Amount, token0Tolerance, token1Tolerance, address(this), block.timestamp
);
```

[VaultLib.sol#L280-L282](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L280-L282)
```solidity
// amountAMin & amountBMin = 0 for 100% tolerence
(raReceived, ctReceived) =
    ammRouter.removeLiquidity(raAddress, ctAddress, lp, 0, 0, address(this), block.timestamp);
```

[VaultLib.sol#L343-L346](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/db23bf67e45781b00ee6de5f6f23e621af16bd7e/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L343-L346)
```solidity
if (ctSellAmount != 0) {
    // 100% tolerance, to ensure this not fail
    ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp)[1];
}
```

The last parameter (`block.timestamp`) is used as the `deadline`, which effectively removes any time constraint on the transaction's execution:

> A malicious block builder can “hold on” to transactions and execute them much later when such transactions are useful for manipulating the price, or for dumping tokens on the user at an unfavorable price. A deadline parameter limits the time window where an attacker can conduct such an exploit. A deadline should be far enough in the future so that there is time to execute the transaction even during congestion, but not longer. This generally means the deadline should be on the order of minutes from when the transaction was signed.
> 
> However, if a smart contract doesn’t incorporate a deadline or makes the parameter useless by ignoring the deadline and forwarding the current block.timestamp to Uniswap, then the user is not protected.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows malicious block builders to hold and delay transactions, potentially executing them at a time when market conditions are unfavorable to the user.

## Recommendation

Modify the function to accept a user-provided `deadline` parameter.
