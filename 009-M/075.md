# Hardcoded slippage in `MathHelper` will prevent users from providing liquidity.

## Summary
Hardcoded slippage in `MathHelper` set to 1% will prevent users from providing liquidity.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look in `MathHelper.sol` , the variable `UNIV2_STATIC_TOLERANCE` is set to 1%, as stated in the protocol `this is used to calculate tolerance level when adding liqudity to AMM pair`. The issue stems from the hardcoding this value to 1% , this may prevent users from providing liquidity during periods of high volatility. There are several affected function such as `depositLv`, `repurchase`, `redeemEarlyLv` and `redeemRaWithDs`.
## Impact
Users will not be able to repurchase/deposit and redeem in periods of high volatility.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Best way of handling this is providing the ability for users to set their own slippage percentage to make sure they can use the function during times of high volatility.
