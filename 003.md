# Missing Expiry Check in Asset Minting Function

## Summary
The mint function in the Asset contract allows token minting without verifying the expiration status of the asset, potentially allowing the creation of tokens for expired assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Asset contract inherits from an Expiry contract which implements expiration functionality. However, the mint function does not utilize this functionality to prevent minting of expired assets:
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```
The contract includes an isExpired() function, but it is not called within the mint function to verify the asset's expiration status before minting.

## Impact
This oversight allows the owner to mint new tokens even after the asset has expired. This could lead to:

1. Violation of the asset's intended lifecycle.
2. Potential economic implications if expired assets are traded or used.

## Proof of Concept
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {Asset} from "../src/Asset.sol";

contract AssetTest is Test {
    Asset asset;
    address owner = address(1);
    uint256 expiryTime = block.timestamp + 1 hours;

    function setUp() public {
        vm.prank(owner);
        asset = new Asset("TEST", "PAIR", owner, expiryTime, 1e18);
    }

    function testMintAfterExpiry() public {
        // Fast forward time past expiry
        vm.warp(expiryTime + 1);
        
        assertTrue(asset.isExpired(), "Asset should be expired");

        uint256 initialSupply = asset.totalSupply();
        
        vm.prank(owner);
        asset.mint(address(2), 1000e18);

        assertEq(asset.totalSupply(), initialSupply + 1000e18, "Tokens should be minted even after expiry");
    }
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an expiry check in the mint function to prevent minting of expired assets. Here's an example of how to modify the function:
```solidity
error AssetExpired();

function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    if (isExpired()) revert AssetExpired();
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```
