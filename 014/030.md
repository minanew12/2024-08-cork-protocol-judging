# `FlashSwapRouter:getCurrentPriceRatio()` is vulnerable to flashloan price manipulation.


## Summary

The `FlashSwapRouter:getCurrentPriceRatio()` function fetches the price ratio of a token pair based on the amounts of tokens in Uniswap reserves. This ratio is highly susceptible to manipulation through flash loans.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `FlashSwapRouter:getCurrentPriceRatio` function is responsible for returning the price ratio of a token pair from the `uniswapPair` by calculating the ratio of both tokens' reserves. It retrieves this price ratio by calling the `DsFlashSwap:getPriceRatio` function.

  - [FlashSwapRouter.sol#L90](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L90)

Within the `DsFlashSwap:getPriceRatio` function:
- It fetches the reserves of the `ct` (collateral token) and `ra` (redemption asset) tokens in the pool and calculates their ratio.
  - [DsFlashSwap.sol#L80-L97](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/DsFlashSwap.sol#L80-L97)

The redemption asset (`RA`) can be `DAI`, `USDT`, `ETH`, or any other token, and its reserves can be easily manipulated using flash loans. Consequently, a malicious user could artificially inflate or deflate the ratio, leading to the unintended minting of more tokens by manipulating the price ratio.

## Impact

The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the price ratio between tokens by temporarily altering the reserves with a flash loan, leading to incorrect pricing and potentially resulting in significant financial loss or the creation of excessive tokens.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing a time-weighted average price (TWAP) for the token pair pricing or using a decentralized oracle that is resistant to manipulation by flash loans.
