# Wrong check in `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier leads to unintended behaviour

## Summary

`LVDepositNotPaused` modifier wrongly check that withdrawal is not paused by admin in vault instead of checking deposit of vault is not paused.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Vault:depositLV` function, a modifier called `LVDepositNotPaused` is used to ensure that deposit of vault is not paused by the admin. If deposit is paused by admin then user must not able to deposit in the vault, this is intended by using `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier. 

However in `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier there is a wrong check which ensure that withdrawal is not paused instead of ensuring the deposit is not paused which is not intended.

```solidity
modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
@>      if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
            revert LVDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
    }
```

Because of this wrong check even if admin pause the deposit of vault, user can still deposit in the vault which makes power of admin to pause the deposits useless.

Also, when admin pause the withdrawal of the vaults, user who wants to deposit in the vault cannot deposit in vault beacuse of wrong check in `LVDepositNotPaused`.

## Impact

User can deposit in vault even if deposit is paused by admin and user cannot deposit in vault when withdrawal is paused by admin.
