# Incorrect Pause Flag Check in LVDepositNotPaused Modifier

## Summary

The `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier in the `ModuleState` contract incorrectly checks the withdrawal pause state instead of the deposit pause state, potentially allowing deposits when they should be paused.

## Vulnerability Detail


In the `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier:

```solidity
modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
    if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
        revert LVDepositPaused();
    }
    _;
}
```

The condition checks `isWithdrawalPaused` instead of a deposit-specific pause flag. This means the deposit functionality is tied to the withdrawal pause state, which is likely not the intended behavior.

## Impact

This error leads to incorrect pausing of deposit functionality in the Liquidity Vault (LV). Specifically:

1. Deposits might be allowed when they should be paused if only deposits are meant to be paused.
2. Deposits might be paused when only withdrawals are meant to be paused.

This could result in unexpected behavior, potentially allowing users to deposit funds when the system is in an unsafe state or preventing deposits when they should be allowed.

## Proof of Concept

Consider a scenario where:
- Deposits should be paused, but withdrawals are still allowed
- The contract sets `isDepositPaused = true` and `isWithdrawalPaused = false`

Current implementation:
```solidity
if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) { // This is false
    revert LVDepositPaused();
}
// The function continues execution, allowing a deposit when it should be paused
```

Correct implementation:
```solidity
if (states[id].vault.config.isDepositPaused) { // This should be true
    revert LVDepositPaused();
}
// The function should revert here, preventing the deposit
```

The current implementation incorrectly allows deposits when they should be paused, based on the withdrawal pause state instead of a deposit-specific pause state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the modifier to check a deposit-specific pause flag:

```solidity
modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
    if (states[id].vault.config.isDepositPaused) {
        revert LVDepositPaused();
    }
    _;
}
```

This will ensure that the deposit functionality is paused independently of the withdrawal functionality, allowing for more granular control over the Liquidity Vault operations.
