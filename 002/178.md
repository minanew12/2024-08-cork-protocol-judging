# Incorrect implementation of the modifier `LVDepositNotPaused`  causes issues when pausing deposits

### Summary

The modifier [LVDepositNotPaused](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleState.sol#L108-L113) is implemented incorrectly and does not work as intended. The modifier is used to pause deposits into the vault if the config variable `isDepositPaused` is set to true. But it does not revert even if `isDepositPaused` is set to true.

### Root Cause

In [ModuleState.sol:109](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleState.sol#L109) the code checks if the config variable `isWithdrawalPaused` set:
```solidity
if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
    revert LVDepositPaused();
}
```

But this modifier should check if the config setting [`isDepositPaused`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/State.sol#L103-L109) is set to true.
