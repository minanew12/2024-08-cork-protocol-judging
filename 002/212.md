# Incorrect implementation of the modifier `LVDepositNotPaused()`

## Summary

The modifier `LVDepositNotPaused()` is intended to check whether deposits to the liquidity vault are paused; however, it mistakenly verifies if withdrawals are paused instead. Consequently, deposits can still be made even when they should be paused.

## Vulnerability Detail

As shown in line 109, the modifier `LVDepositNotPaused()` checks whether withdrawals are paused instead of verifying if deposits are paused. Consequently, if deposits are paused while withdrawals are not, [deposits to the liquidity vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/tree/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Vault.sol#L33) can still occur, as the incorrect modifier `LVDepositNotPaused()` is being used.

```solidity
    modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
109     if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
            revert LVDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
    }
```

## Impact

Pausing deposits is ineffective, allowing users to continue depositing into the liquidity vault even when deposits are supposed to be paused.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The modifier should be corrected as follows.

```diff
    modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
-       if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
+       if (states[id].vault.config.isDepositPaused) {
            revert LVDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
    }
```
