# LVDepositNotPaused modifier does not work correctly

### Summary

The `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier in the `ModuleState.sol` contract is intended to check if deposits are paused. However, it mistakenly checks if withdrawals are paused instead.

### Root Cause

The issue comes from the modifier utilizing the wrong property to determine if deposits are paused. Specifically, it references `isWithdrawalPaused` rather than the correct `isDepositPaused`.

### Internal pre-conditions

The owner must pause deposits

### External pre-conditions

There are no external preconditions

### Attack Path

1. The owner pause deposits
2. A user attempts to make a deposit

### Impact


If the deposit functionality is paused, the `LVDepositNotPaused` modifier will not enforce this pause because it checks the wrong property. As a result, deposits may still go through when they should be blocked, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the contract.


### PoC

The current implementation of the modifier is as follows

```solidity
modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
        if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {
            revert LVDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
}
```

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the modifier should be updated to reference the correct property, `isDepositPaused`. 

Here's how it must looks like:

```diff
modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
        if (states[id].vault.config.isDepositPaused) {
            revert LVDepositPaused();
        }
        _;
}
```
