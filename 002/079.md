# Incorrect Flag Check for Deposit Pause in `ModuleState::LVDepositNotPaused` Modifier


## Summary
The `ModuleState::LVDepositNotPaused` modifier is intended to check whether `deposits` are paused, but it incorrectly checks the `isWithdrawalPaused` flag. This could lead to unexpected behavior where deposits are not properly restricted even when they are intended to be paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
The modifier `ModuleState::LVDepositNotPaused` should verify that deposits are not paused by checking the appropriate deposit-related flag in the configuration. However, it mistakenly checks the `isWithdrawalPaused` flag, which pertains to withdrawals, not deposits. As a result, this could allow deposits to be accepted even when they should be paused, potentially violating the intended logic of the protocol.

## Impact
This issue affects the core functionality of the protocol, as deposits could continue despite an intention to pause them, resulting in a failure to halt new liquidity from entering the system during critical periods. This could lead to unintended fund flow, increase the protocol's risk exposure, and potentially disrupt the protocol's operations in emergency scenarios.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the `ModuleState::LVDepositNotPaused` modifier to check the correct deposit-related flag in the configuration, such as `isDepositPaused`, instead of `isWithdrawalPaused`. This will ensure that deposits are properly restricted when necessary.

**Suggested Fix:**

```diff
modifier LVDepositNotPaused(Id id) {
+    if (states[id].vault.config.isDepositPaused) {
-    if (states[id].vault.config.isWithdrawalPaused) {

        revert LVDepositPaused();
    }
    _;
}


```
