# amount is downcasted to uint112 without overflow protection

### Summary

The ra and ct amounts are downcast from uint256 to uint112 at various places in DsFlashSwap.sol, as highlighted above. If you pass an amount such as type(uint112).max + 1 to getAmountIn() or getAmountOutSellDS(), it would result in a very large value, which could confuse chain indexers."

### PoC

function getAmountIn(ReserveState storage self, uint256 dsId, uint256 amountOut)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 amountIn)
    {
        (uint112 raReserve, uint112 ctReserve,) = self.ds[dsId].pair.getReserves();

        amountIn = SwapperMathLibrary.getAmountIn(amountOut, raReserve, ctReserve, self.ds[dsId].ds.exchangeRate());
    }

    function getAmountOutSellDS(AssetPair storage assetPair, uint256 amount)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 repaymentAmount)
    {
        (uint112 raReserve, uint112 ctReserve) = getReservesSorted(assetPair);
        // we calculate the repayment amount based on the imbalanced ct reserve since we borrow CT from the AMM
        repaymentAmount = MinimalUniswapV2Library.getAmountIn(amount, raReserve, ctReserve - amount);

        // the amountOut is essentially what the user receive, we can calculate this by simply subtracting the repayment amount
        // from the amount, since we're getting back the same RA amount as DS user buy, this works. to get the effective price per DS,
        // you would devide this by the DS amount user bought.
        // note that we subtract 1 to enforce uni v2 rules
        amountOut = amount - repaymentAmount;

        // enforce uni v2 rules, pay 1 wei more
        amountOut -= 1;
        repaymentAmount += 1;

        assert(amountOut + repaymentAmount == amount);
    }

    function getAmountOutBuyDS(AssetPair storage assetPair, uint256 amount)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 amountOut, uint256 borrowedAmount, uint256 repaymentAmount)
    {
        (uint112 raReserve, uint112 ctReserve) = getReservesSorted(assetPair);

        (borrowedAmount, amountOut) =
            SwapperMathLibrary.getAmountOutDs(int256(uint256(raReserve)), int256(uint256(ctReserve)), int256(amount));

        repaymentAmount = MinimalUniswapV2Library.getAmountIn(borrowedAmount, ctReserve, raReserve - borrowedAmount);
    }

    function isRAsupportsPermit(address token) internal view returns (bool) {
        return PermitChecker.supportsPermit(token);
    }
}

### Mitigation

Use SafeCast.toUint112 to safely downcast. Now if amount exceeds uint112's max value, it reverts.
