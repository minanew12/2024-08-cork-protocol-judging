# Exchange Rate not accounted for over various instances in the protocol causing discrepancy

## Summary
There are multiple instances where exchange rate of ra : ct + ds is not accounted for in conversion. This will cause loss of funds for protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a function ``unsafeIssueToLv``
```Solidity
    function unsafeIssueToLv(State storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
        uint256 dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;


        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];


        self.psm.balances.ra.incLocked(amount);


        ds.issue(address(this), amount);
    }
```
When this function is called in ``__provideLiquidity()`` function which is invoked whenever we are providing liquidity to the amm pair.
The idea behind this is that we break incoming ra in such a way such that some ra is used to mint CT + DS and other ra is used as liquidity. This is done to ensure that the ratio of liquidity going to the pair is optimal. 
Suppose we need 2 ra to get 1 ct + 1 ds and user deposit 10 ds then 5 ra will be used to mint 2.5ct + 2.5ds and the remaining 5 will be used as liquidity.
But when we are calling ``unsafeIssueToLv()`` we are not accounting for this exchange rate and directly increasing 5 as amount. 
There are many instances where this is happened.

## Impact
Lack of exchange rate accounting will cause direct loss of funds to the protocol
