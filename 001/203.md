# Users of the `FlashSwapRouter` will repay too much `Ct` to the `Amm` due to mixing the `amountOut` and `repayAmount` variables

### Summary

[FlashSwapRouter::_swapRaforDs()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L98) calls [DsFlashSwap::getAmountOutBuyDS()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L109), which calls [UniswapV2Library::getAmountIn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/DsFlashSwap.sol#L189) to get the `repaymentAmount` of `Ct` tokens. However, this variable is not used anymore, and the `FlashSwapRouter` later on the `Uniswap` callback [FlashSwapRouter::uniswapV2Call() ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L338) calls internally [FlashSwapRouter::__afterFlashswapBuy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L349) which [repays](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L377) the flash loan with `ct` tokens equal to the `Ds` attributed, instead of the required `repaymentAmount` calculated earlier.

This means users will take losses and send too many `Ct` to the `Amm`, which are stolen later by some other user.

### Root Cause

In `FlashSwapRouter.sol:377`, all the received `Ct` tokens are repaid to the `Amm`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `FlashSwapRouter::swapRaforDs()`, over repaying the flash loan.

### Impact

Users loses funds for bots that claim these funds later in the Amm.

### PoC

`FlashSwapRouter`
```solidity
function _swapRaforDs(
    ReserveState storage self,
    AssetPair storage assetPair,
    Id reserveId,
    uint256 dsId,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 amountOutMin
) internal returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    uint256 borrowedAmount;

    // calculate the amount of DS tokens attributed
    (amountOut, borrowedAmount,) = assetPair.getAmountOutBuyDS(amount); //@audit repayment amount is ignored
    ...
}

...

function __afterFlashswapBuy(
    ReserveState storage self,
    Id reserveId,
    uint256 dsId,
    address caller,
    uint256 dsAttributed
) internal {
    AssetPair storage assetPair = self.ds[dsId];
    assetPair.ra.approve(owner(), dsAttributed);

    IPSMcore psm = IPSMcore(owner());
    psm.depositPsm(reserveId, dsAttributed);

    // should be the same, we don't compare with the RA amount since we maybe dealing
    // with a non-rebasing token, in which case the amount deposited and the amount received will always be different
    // so we simply enforce that the amount received is equal to the amount attributed to the user

    // send caller their DS
    assetPair.ds.transfer(caller, dsAttributed);
    // repay flash loan
    assetPair.ct.transfer(msg.sender, dsAttributed); //@audit all ct tokens are sent to repay, will be in excess
}
```

### Mitigation

Only repay the required amount of `ct` tokens. The extra ct should go to the user or similar.
