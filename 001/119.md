# Incorrect redeemAmount Is Accounted Due To Not Accounting For The  Exchange Rate

## Summary

When Liquidating LP , DS and CT are paired , then that amount is used to redeem RA . But the accounting for RA has been done incorrectly since it does not account for exchange rate.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) Inside Liquidate LP we empty out the DS reserve and pair it up with the CT amount returned from the AMM ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L376

This is the amount of CtDs being redeemed.

2.) This same amount has been accounted for the increment in RA ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L390

But this is incorrect , this is because `redeemAmount` is an amount in Ct/Ds not in RA , to make it into RA we need to apply the exchange rate over it(exchange rate is how many Redemption Assets you need to deposit to receive 1 Cover Token + 1 Depeg Swap and how many Redemption Assets you receive when redeeming 1 Pegged Asset + 1 Depeg Swap , read more in the Dealing with non-rebasing Pegged Assets section -> https://corkfi.notion.site/Cork-Protocol-Litepaper-f21a57d5c19d48209dfa0f0c2ab776c4).

3.) Therefore incorrect RA amount has been accounted and incorrect amount of RA would be reserved ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L392

meaning , incorrect amount of RA attributed to be withdrawn/redeemed.

4.) This inconsistency is found at multiple places , and instead of making separate reports  im listing them here ->

a.) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L122

The amount here is in RA and we are issuing DS/CT with it.

b.) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L368

dsAttributed is in DS and we are depositing RA.

c.) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L331

redeemAmount is in Ct/Ds here
