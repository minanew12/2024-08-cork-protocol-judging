# lockUnchecked() is used instead lockFrom() in PsmLib.repurchase() leading to wrong accounting of locked RA tokens.

## Summary

When users interact with the PSM and provide RA, the `lockFrom()` function is used to account for the deposited tokens. Conversely, when users withdraw RA from the PSM, the `unlockTo()` function is used to track the RA being withdrawn.
## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation of the `repurchase()` function in `PsmLib.sol` fails to properly account for the RA tokens provided by the user, as it incorrectly uses `lockUnchecked()` instead of `lockFrom()`. The `lockFrom()` function not only transfers the RA tokens but also updates the locked balance, which is crucial for tracking the tokens that are available to reward users.

By using `lockUnchecked()`, the locked RA tokens are not accounted for, leading to an incorrect balance. This can result in fewer tokens being available for rewards, causing users to receive less than expected.
```solidity
function repurchase(
        State storage self,
        address buyer,
        uint256 amount,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
    ) internal returns (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 feePrecentage, uint256 fee, uint256 exchangeRates) {
        DepegSwap storage ds;

        (dsId, received, feePrecentage, fee, exchangeRates, ds) = previewRepurchase(self, amount);

        // decrease PSM balance
        // we also include the fee here to separate the accumulated fee from the repurchase
        self.psm.balances.paBalance -= (received);
        self.psm.balances.dsBalance -= (received);

        // transfer user RA to the PSM/LV
        // @audit shouldnt it be lock checked, deposit -> redeemWithDs -> repurchase - locked would be 0
        self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);

        // transfer user attrubuted DS + PA
        // PA
        (, address pa) = self.info.underlyingAsset();
        IERC20(pa).safeTransfer(buyer, received);

        // DS
        IERC20(ds._address).transfer(buyer, received);

        // Provide liquidity
        VaultLibrary.provideLiquidityWithFee(self, fee, flashSwapRouter, ammRouter);
    }
```

In `LvAssetLib.sol`:
```solidity
function incLocked(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.locked = self.locked + amount;
    }

    function decLocked(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.locked = self.locked - amount;
    }

    function lockFrom(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount, address from) internal {
        incLocked(self, amount);
        lockUnchecked(self, amount, from);
    }

    function unlockTo(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount, address to) internal {
        decLocked(self, amount);
        self.asErc20().transfer(to, amount);
    }

    function lockUnchecked(LvAsset storage self, uint256 amount, address from) internal {
        ERC20(self._address).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
    }

```
## Impact

Less rewards than expected + locked RA tokens in the contract.
