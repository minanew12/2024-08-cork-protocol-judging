# ctReservsr can be reduced excessively when previewing swap for Ra for DS causing preview deficit in ctReserve leading to wrong amountOut

## Summary
The `previewSwapRaforDs` function is designed to simulate the amount of DS tokens (Depeg Swap tokens) that will be received when swapping RA tokens. However, the logic within this function introduces a significant bug related to how the CT reserve (Cover Tokens) is adjusted, which could have severe repercussions on the liquidity and stability of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see within the `previewSwapRaforDs` function, the CT reserve is adjusted based on the variable `amountSellFromReserve.` This variable represents the amount of DS tokens that need to be sold from the Liquidity Vault (LV) to facilitate the swap. However, DS tokens and CT tokens are distinct assets within the protocol, and their reserves should not directly influence one another.
```solidity
uint256 amountSellFromReserve = 
    amountOut - MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(self.reserveSellPressurePrecentage, amountOut);

// Sell all tokens if the sell amount is higher than the available reserve
amountSellFromReserve = assetPair.reserve < amountSellFromReserve ? assetPair.reserve : amountSellFromReserve;

// Adjust CT reserve incorrectly based on amountSellFromReserve
ctReserve -= uint112(amountSellFromReserve);
```
The `getAmountOutBuyDS` function returns both `amountOut` and `borrowedAmount`, where which the `borrowedAmount` is supposed to represent the specific quantity of CT tokens required to facilitate the swap. However, this `borrowedAmount` is calculated but never utilized within the `previewSwapRaforDs` function, leading to a disconnect between the calculated reserve needs and the actual adjustments made to the CT reserve.
```solidity
uint256 borrowedAmount;
(amountOut, borrowedAmount,) = assetPair.getAmountOutBuyDS(amount);

// borrowedAmount is calculated but not used for reserve adjustment
```
Suppose the Liquidity Vault has a CT reserve of 1,000 CT tokens. A user initiates a swap that requires 200 CT tokens (borrowedAmount). However, due to the flawed logic, the function incorrectly adjusts the CT reserve using amountSellFromReserve (e.g., 300 DS tokens).

The CT reserve is reduced by 300 tokens instead of 200, leaving only 700 CT tokens in the reserve. This unnecessary depletion could prevent the LV from supporting future swaps, destabilizing the liquidity pool.

Therefore using a wrong amount to reduce the reserve of CT. 

The `amountSellFromReserve` is a variable that represents the amount of DS tokens (Depeg Swap tokens) that needs to be sold from the Liquidity Vault (LV) reserve to facilitate a swap.
 Essentially, it calculates how much of the DS tokens held in the LV reserve will be sold to achieve the desired swap outcome.
```solidity
// we borrow the same amount of CT tokens from the reserve
            ctReserve -= uint112(amountSellFromReserve);
```
AmountSellFromReserve has nothing to do with CT reserve as you can see above from it usage, But the `borrowedAmount` is the specific quantity of CT tokens that is calculated as necessary to facilitate the swap. Itâ€™s the amount of CT tokens the system would theoretically "borrow" from the CT reserve to ensure the swap can be executed.

However the [amountSellFromReserve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/e77d293c0fbe3ecb6d47ddde9491ade2cf99fbba/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L219) shouldn't impact the CT reserve directly instead use `borrowedAmount` which represent the CT tokens required. 

As you can see the current logic could result in reserve imbalances due to improper handling of the `ctReserve` and `raReserve` adjustments. Specifically, the subtraction of `amountSellFromReserve` from ctReserve does not reflect the repayment of the borrowed CT tokens, leading to inaccurate reserve values. 
From [getAmountOutSellDS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/e77d293c0fbe3ecb6d47ddde9491ade2cf99fbba/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L221) to [getAmountIn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/e77d293c0fbe3ecb6d47ddde9491ade2cf99fbba/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/DsFlashSwap.sol#L164) 
```solidity
repaymentAmount = MinimalUniswapV2Library.getAmountIn(amount, raReserve, ctReserve - amount);
```
This line reduces the `ctReserve` before calculating the `repaymentAmount`, which can lead to inaccurate calculations, especially when amount is close to or larger than the `ctReserve` since it was not the borrowedAmount when buying DS. 

## Impact
Since `amountSellFromReserve` is higher than the actual CT tokens needed (borrowedAmount), the CT reserve is reduced excessively, depleting the reserve prematurely and impairing future swaps.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
function previewSwapRaforDs(Id reserveId, uint256 dsId, uint256 amount) external view returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        ReserveState storage self = reserves[reserveId];
        AssetPair storage assetPair = self.ds[dsId];

        uint256 borrowedAmount;
        (amountOut, borrowedAmount,) = assetPair.getAmountOutBuyDS(amount);

        // calculate the amount of DS tokens that will be sold from LV reserve
        uint256 amountSellFromReserve =
            amountOut - MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(self.reserveSellPressurePrecentage, amountOut);

        // sell all tokens if the sell amount is higher than the available reserve
        amountSellFromReserve = assetPair.reserve < amountSellFromReserve ? assetPair.reserve : amountSellFromReserve;

        // sell the DS tokens from the reserve if there's any
        if (amountSellFromReserve != 0) {
            (uint112 raReserve, uint112 ctReserve) = assetPair.getReservesSorted();

            // we borrow the same amount of CT tokens from the reserve
            ctReserve -= uint112(amountSellFromReserve);   <-----------@audit The CT tokens should be that of the borrowedAmount

            (uint256 vaultRa, uint256 raAdded) = assetPair.getAmountOutSellDS(amountSellFromReserve);
            raReserve += uint112(raAdded);

            // emulate Vault way of adding liquidity using RA from selling DS reserve
            (, uint256 ratio) = self.tryGetPriceRatioAfterSellDs(dsId, amountSellFromReserve, raAdded);
            uint256 ctAdded;
            (raAdded, ctAdded) = MathHelper.calculateProvideLiquidityAmountBasedOnCtPrice(vaultRa, ratio);

            raReserve += uint112(raAdded);
            ctReserve += uint112(ctAdded);

            // update amountOut since we sold some from the reserve
            (, amountOut) = SwapperMathLibrary.getAmountOutDs(
                int256(uint256(raReserve)), int256(uint256(ctReserve)), int256(amount)
            );
        }
    }
```
Before getting the  amountOut sell DS, the `ctReserve` has already been deducted by the `amountSellFromReserve`, the way `ctReserve` is adjusted [before](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/e77d293c0fbe3ecb6d47ddde9491ade2cf99fbba/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/flash-swaps/FlashSwapRouter.sol#L219) and during the calculation in [getAmountOutSellDS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/e77d293c0fbe3ecb6d47ddde9491ade2cf99fbba/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/DsFlashSwap.sol#L164)results in a misleading reserve state. The reserve's state should ideally reflect the borrowing of CT tokens (borrowedAmount), not a pre-deducted value based on `amountSellFromReserve.`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the incorrect usage of `amountSellFromReserve` for CT reserve adjustments with the proper utilization of borrowedAmount. The CT reserve should be directly reduced by the borrowedAmount to accurately reflect the liquidity needs for the swap.

> I feel that the logic for handling CT tokens when buying DS should be mirrored when selling DS, but with a reversal of operations (i.e., repayment instead of borrowing). 

Instead of reducing ctReserve by `amountSellFromReserve`, use the `borrowedAmount` to adjust the `ctReserve`. This makes sure that only the borrowed amount is repaid, and no excess or deficit occurs in the CT reserve.

```solidity
// Correct reserve adjustment by using borrowedAmount
ctReserve -= uint112(borrowedAmount);
```
Pass the original `ctReserve` to `getAmountOutSellDS`
```solidity
uint256 repaymentAmount = MinimalUniswapV2Library.getAmountIn(amountSellFromReserve, raReserve, ctReserve);
```
