# Incorrect implementation of the `PsmLib.unsafeIssueToLv()` function

## Summary

The `unsafeIssueToLv()` function is called when exchanging `RA` for `CT + DS` (during [liquidity provision](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/tree/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L167) into the Uniswap pool). This function increases the locked amount of `RA` while simultaneously minting `CT + DS`. However, the issue arises because the increase in the locked amount of `RA` is equal to the amount of newly minted `CT + DS`, even though there is an exchange rate between `RA` and `CT + DS`.

## Vulnerability Detail

As indicated at line 120, the `unsafeIssueToLv()` function increases the value of `psm.balances.ra.locked` by `amount`, which represents the newly minted `CT + DS`. This is incorrect because there is an exchange rate (which may not be 1:1) between `RA` and `CT + DS`.

For instance, if the exchange rate is 1.17 and `amount` is 1000, the required amount of `RA` to mint 1000 `CT + DS` would be `1000 * 1.17 = 1170`. Therefore, the increase in the locked amount of `RA` should be 1170. However, in the current logic, it is only set to 1000.

As a result, `psm.balances.ra.locked` will be less than it should be, leading to a loss of funds for users, as the locked `RA` will be distributed to users after expiry.

```solidity
    function unsafeIssueToLv(State storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
        uint256 dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;

        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];

120     self.psm.balances.ra.incLocked(amount);

        ds.issue(address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Impact

Loss of `RA` for users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revise the `unsafeIssueToLv()` function to accurately handle the increase in the locked amount of `RA`.
