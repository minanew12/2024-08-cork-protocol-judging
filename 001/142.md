# Premature Redemption allows Users to Lose their LV Tokens without Redeeming RA or PA Tokens


## Summary

When a user calls `requestRedemption` and adds their request to the `withdrawEligible` map, they expect to redeem a certain amount of Ra tokens. However, if they attempt to redeem those tokens before the Depeg Swap (DS) expires by calling `redeemExpired` they lost thier lv tokens without receiving any RA:PA tokens.


## Vulnerability Detail


#### 1. **User Requests Redemption (`requestRedemption` Function)**

- A user calls the `requestRedemption` function to redeem a certain amount of Ra tokens (e.g., 100e18 Ra tokens).
- The function:
  - Updates the `withdrawEligible` mapping by adding the amount of Ra tokens the user wants to redeem.
  - Increases the `withdrawalPool.atrributedLv` by the same amount.
  - Locks and Transferthe user's LV tokens via the `self.vault.lv.lockFrom(amount, owner)` function.

```solidity
    function requestRedemption(
        State storage self,
        address owner,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory rawLvPermitSig,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external {
        safeBeforeExpired(self);
        if (deadline != 0) {
            DepegSwapLibrary.permit(self.vault.lv._address, rawLvPermitSig, owner, address(this), amount, deadline);
        }
        self.vault.pool.withdrawEligible[owner] += amount;
        self.vault.pool.withdrawalPool.atrributedLv += amount;
        self.vault.lv.lockFrom(amount, owner);
    }
```
At this point, the user's intention to redeem Ra tokens is recorded, and their LV tokens are locked and transfered to vault.

#### 2. **User Calls `redeemExpired` Function Before DS Expiry**

- The user calls the `redeemExpired` function, attempting to redeem their tokens before the Depeg Swap (DS) expires.
- The function checks if the Depeg Swap has expired using `ds.isExpired()`.
  - If the Depeg Swap has **not** expired (`ds.isExpired()` returns `false`), the function continues without reverting.
  - If the user is eligible for withdrawal (`userEligible > 0`), the function allows the redemption to proceed, even though the DS has not expired.

```solidity
function redeemExpired(

          //...

            if (userEligible == 0 && !ds.isExpired()) {
                revert Unauthorized(owner);
            }

            // user can only redeem up to the amount they requested, when there's a DS active
            // if there's no DS active, then there's no cap on the amount of LV that can be redeemed
            if (!ds.isExpired() && userEligible < amount) {
                revert InsufficientBalance(owner, amount, userEligible);
            }

            if (ds.isExpired() && !self.vault.lpLiquidated.get(dsId)) {
                _liquidatedLp(self, dsId, ammRouter, flashSwapRouter);
                assert(self.vault.balances.ra.locked == 0);
            }

           //... 
        }
```

#### 3. **Redemption Calculation and Token Burning**

- The `redeem` function is called, which determines the amount of Ra and Pa tokens to return to the user. However:
  - The `ra` and `pa` amounts are calculated based on the withdrawal pool's exchange rates.
  - The `withdrawalPool.raExchangeRate` and `withdrawalPool.paExchangeRate` are not initialized because these variables are initialized using the `reserve` function, which is called during the `_liquidatedLp` process. Since the `reserve` function is not called when Ra tokens are deposited, the `__tryRedeemfromWithdrawalPool` function returns zero for both `ra` and `pa`.

```solidity
    function redeem(VaultPool storage self, uint256 amount, address owner)
        internal
        returns (uint256 ra, uint256 pa, uint256 excess, uint256 attributed)
    {
        uint256 userEligible = self.withdrawEligible[owner];

        if (userEligible >= amount) {
@>>           attributed = amount;

@>>            (ra, pa) = __redeemfromWithdrawalPool(self, amount);
            __decreaseUserAttributed(self, amount, owner);
        } else {
            attributed = userEligible;
            excess = amount - userEligible;

            assert(excess + attributed == amount);

            (ra, pa) = __redeemExcessFromAmmPool(self, userEligible, excess);
            __decreaseUserAttributed(self, userEligible, owner);
        }
    }
```
This means the user receives **no tokens** in return.

#### 4. **Redemption Calculation and Token Burning**
 
- The `redeem` function is return, attributedRa = 0 attributedPa = 0, burnUserAmount = 0, burnSelfAmount = 100e18

```solidity
        (attributedRa, attributedPa, burnUserAmount, burnSelfAmount) = self.vault.pool.redeem(amount, owner);
```  


#### 5. **Users could lose their Ra tokens without receiving any assets in return**

- `burnSelf` will burn the userEligible tokens that was transfered into protocol.
- The user loses their Ra tokens without receiving any assets in return.

```solidity
       (attributedRa, attributedPa, burnUserAmount, burnSelfAmount) = self.vault.pool.redeem(amount, owner);
        assert(burnSelfAmount + burnUserAmount == amount);

        if (deadline != 0) {
            DepegSwapLibrary.permit(
                self.vault.lv._address, rawLvPermitSig, owner, address(this), burnUserAmount, deadline
            );
        }
        //ra
        IERC20(self.info.pair1).safeTransfer(receiver, attributedRa);
        //pa
        IERC20(self.info.pair0).safeTransfer(receiver, attributedPa);

@>>        self.vault.lv.burnSelf(burnSelfAmount);

        if (burnUserAmount != 0) {
            ERC20Burnable(self.vault.lv._address).burnFrom(owner, burnUserAmount);
        }
    }
```


## Impact

Users could lose their Ra tokens without receiving any assets in return due to this logic flaw.

## Recommendation

The `redeemExpired` function should check `ds.isExpired()` and revert if not expired, rather than allowing redemption to proceed. This makes the expiration check explicit and prevents bypassing.
