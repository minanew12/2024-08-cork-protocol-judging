# Incorrect repurchase logic

## Summary
The incorrect repurchase logic allows attackers to set ra.self.locked in PSM to 0. When ra.self.locked is 0, the user cannot retrieve Ra in PSM when calling the redeemWithCT function, and Ra in PSM is locked forever.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the attacker calls the repurchase function to use Ra to purchase Pa and Ds, the contract uses the lockUnchecked function to transfer Ra, and self.locked will not increase. Then when the attacker calls the redeemRaWithDs function to redeem Ra with Pa and Ds, the contract uses the unlockTo function to transfer Ra, and self.locked will decrease.

Detailed example (all fees will be ignored to make the example simple enough):

0. PSM:
Bob: ra.balance = 100 pa.balance = 100
attacker: ra.balance = 100

1. Bob deposits 100Ra.
PSM: ra.locked = 100 ra.balance = 100
Bob: ds.balance = 100 ct.balacne = 100 pa.balance = 100

2. Bob buys 50Ra with 50Pa and 50DS.
PSM: ra.locked = 50 ra.balance = 50 pa.balance = 50 ds.balance = 50
Bob: ra.balance = 50 pa.balance = 50 ds.balance = 50 ct.balacne = 100
attacker: ra.balance = 100

3. The attacker uses 50Ra to purchase 50Pa and 50Ds.
PSM: ra.locked = 50 ra.balance = 100
Bob: ra.balance = 50 pa.balance = 50 ds.balance = 50 ct.balacne = 100
attacker: ra.balance = 50 pa.balance = 50 ds.balance = 50

4. The attacker uses 50Pa and 5 0Ds Buy 50Ra.
PSM: ra.balance = 50 pa.balance = 50 ds.balance = 50 ra.locked = 0
Bob: ra.balance = 50 pa.balance = 50 ds.balance = 50 ct.balacne = 100
attacker: ra.balance = 100

At this time, user bob will lose 50ra.

        (dsId, received, feePrecentage, fee, exchangeRates, ds) = previewRepurchase(self, amount);

        // decrease PSM balance
        // we also include the fee here to separate the accumulated fee from the repurchase
        self.psm.balances.paBalance -= (received);
        self.psm.balances.dsBalance -= (received);

        // transfer user RA to the PSM/LV
-       self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);
+       self.psm.balances.ra.lockFrom(amount, buyer);
        // transfer user attrubuted DS + PA
        // PA
        (, address pa) = self.info.underlyingAsset();
        IERC20(pa).safeTransfer(buyer, received);

        // DS
        IERC20(ds._address).transfer(buyer, received);
