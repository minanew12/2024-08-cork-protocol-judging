# H - 8 No slippage check in a Uniswap v2/v3 trade in VaultLib.sol

## Summary
Frontrunning is a common issue in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, where malicious bots monitor the transaction mempool and execute transactions before others to capitalize on price fluctuations or arbitrage opportunities.

To mitigate the risk of frontrunning, and also to be able to make successful (non-reverting) calls to UniswapV2, it is crucial to implement slippage protection by setting an appropriate amountOutMin parameter when executing swaps or other transactions involving token exchanges. The amountOutMin parameter ensures that a transaction will only be executed if the user receives at least the specified minimum amount of output tokens.

The functions' strict enforcement of 0 slippage in UniswapV2 Router calls makes them vulnerable to sandwich attacks, front-running, and other MEV-based attacks exploiting arbitrage opportunities created by the lack of slippage protection.

When successfully exploited, the potential consequences include:

- Financial loss: Attackers could manipulate the price of tokens during the execution of a trade, causing the victim to buy or sell at unfavorable rates, resulting in financial loss.
- Arbitrage opportunities: Exploitation of the lack of slippage protection could allow attackers to frontrun transactions, taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities at the expense of the original transaction sender.
- Transaction failure: In some cases, the lack of slippage tolerance could cause transactions to fail, as the expected price might not be achievable due to market fluctuations or manipulation by attackers.
- Loss of trust: The exploitation of such vulnerabilities could lead to a loss of trust in the platform or contract, potentially damaging its reputation and user base.

## Vulnerability Detail
### One flow => 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L639


1.  Monitor for calls to redeemEarly (VaultLib.sol:639-665).
2. When a large redemption is detected, front-run it with the following steps:
a. Use FlashSwapRouter to perform a large swap, inflating the price of RA.
b. Execute multiple smaller trades on the AMM to further manipulate the price.
4. Let the redeemEarly transaction execute. It will call _liquidateLpPartial (VaultLib.sol:292-316), which in turn calls _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt (VaultLib.sol:318-347).
5. The vulnerable line ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp)[1]; will execute with no slippage protection, resulting in a much lower amount of RA received than expected.

6. Immediately after, execute a large trade to bring the price back down, profiting from the difference.
7.The user calling redeemEarly will receive significantly less value than expected due to the manipulated exchange rate.

### Other flow =>
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Vault.sol#L168

This function, redeemEarlyLv, calls into the VaultLib's redeemEarly function, which ultimately leads to the vulnerable swapExactTokensForTokens call.

The attack flow would be similar:

1. Monitor the mempool for redeemEarlyLv calls.
2. Front-run with price manipulation transactions.
3. Let the redeemEarlyLv execute, which will use the manipulated prices.
4. Back-run to profit from the price difference.
5. This entry point provides another vector to exploit the slippage issue, potentially allowing for larger-scale attacks due to its public visibility in the Vault contract.

## Impact
The user calling redeemEarly will receive significantly less value than expected due to the manipulated exchange rate.

## Recommendation

Enforce a minimum amount out, or create an uint parameter that could be used with off-chain calculations based on slippage tolerance.
