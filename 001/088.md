# Vaults's redeemExpired function allows premature redemptions leading to potential exploitation

### Summary

Flawed implementation of redeemExpired allows users to redeem prematurely before expiry or exploit favorable previous rates, violating the intended protocol behavior and fee structure. For the first issuance if will result in complete loss of LV tokens due to uninitialised exchange rates.

### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L530-L549

The vulnerability stems from a combination of issues in the VaultLibrary contract, primarily affecting the redeemExpired and requestRedemption functions. The core problems can be broken down as follows:
a) redeemExpired is allowed when a DS is active for eligible amounts:
In the redeemExpired function:
```solidity
function redeemExpired(
    State storage self,
    address owner,
    address receiver,
    uint256 amount,
    IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
    IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
    bytes memory rawLvPermitSig,
    uint256 deadline
) external returns (uint256 attributedRa, uint256 attributedPa) {
    {
        uint256 dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];

        uint256 userEligible = self.vault.pool.withdrawEligible[owner];

        if (userEligible == 0 && !ds.isExpired()) {
            revert Unauthorized(owner);
        }

        if (!ds.isExpired() && userEligible < amount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance(owner, amount, userEligible);
        }

        // ... (rest of the function)
    }
}
```
The function allows redemptions even when the DS is not expired, as long as the user has a non-zero withdrawEligible amount. This is evident from the conditional checks that only revert if userEligible is 0 and the DS is not expired.
b) Users can set eligible amount by sending a redemption request:
The requestRedemption function allows users to increase their withdrawEligible amount at any time:
```solidity
function requestRedemption(
    State storage self,
    address owner,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory rawLvPermitSig,
    uint256 deadline
) external {
    safeBeforeExpired(self);
    // ... (permit logic)
    self.vault.pool.withdrawEligible[owner] += amount;
    self.vault.pool.withdrawalPool.atrributedLv += amount;
    self.vault.lv.lockFrom(amount, owner);
}
```
This function increases the user's withdrawEligible amount without any restrictions on timing or frequency.
c) Users can redeem even before expiry:
As a result of points (a) and (b), users can effectively redeem their LV tokens before the DS expiry by:

Calling requestRedemption to set their withdrawEligible amount
Immediately calling redeemExpired, which will succeed due to the non-zero withdrawEligible amount

The redeemExpired function lacks a strict check for DS expiry when a user has a non-zero withdrawEligible amount. This allows for pre-expiry redemptions without applying any early redemption fees or penalties.

First Issuance:
This issue is particularly severe during the first issuance period. If redeemExpired is called before the first DS expiry, it may lead to a complete loss of LV tokens due to potentially uninitialized or incorrect exchange rates.
```solidity
function __tryRedeemfromWithdrawalPool(VaultPool storage self, uint256 amount)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 ra, uint256 pa)
{
    ra = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, self.withdrawalPool.raExchangeRate);
    pa = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, self.withdrawalPool.paExchangeRate);
}
```
The critical issue here is that during the first issuance, before proper initialization, self.withdrawalPool.raExchangeRate and self.withdrawalPool.paExchangeRate may be set to their default values (0).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A new DS issuance must be active but not yet expired
2. User can call requestRedemption at any time, including during the current DS period


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. During an active DS period, user calls requestRedemption with a desired amount of LV tokens
2. Immediately after, user calls redeemExpired
3. The function allows redemption using current rates without applying the early redemption fee
4. User receives assets based on current rates, avoiding the early redemption fee that should apply for pre-expiry redemptions

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of fees that should have been collected for early redemptions. Users can receive redemption without incurring the intended early redemption fees, even for requests made within the current DS period. This undermines the protocol's fee structure and intended mechanics for early redemptions. It could result in significant financial losses for the protocol, especially if many users exploit this issue or if it's exploited during periods of high volatility.
This is against the intended behavior as outlined in the litepaper:
Before Expiry

> **Liquidity Vault Base Withdrawal Mechanism**
> 
> Prior to the expiry, Liquidity Vault tokenholders can request a withdrawal. The request will be processed at expiry and can thereafter be claimed in exchange for burning the Liquidity Vault Token.

After Expiry

> The amount of Redemption Asset attributed per Liquidity Vault token from steps 1-4, minus a fee can be claimed by the Liquidity Vault tokenholder in exchange for burning their Liquidity Vault token

For first issuance: LV token holders suffer a complete or near-complete loss of their redeemed assets. Users who call redeemExpired before actual expiry will burn their LV tokens but receive zero assets in return, effectively losing the entire value of their position.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an expiry check at the beginning of the redeemExpired function.
