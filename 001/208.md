# Inability to redeem remaining DS+PA after `redeemRaWithCt` call.


### Summary

The redeemRaWithCt function resets the RA balances, preventing any remaining RA from being redeemed if redeemRaWithDs is not also called.

### Vulnerability Details

When `redeemRaWithCt` is called, it resets the RA balances to zero by calling `_separateLiquidity`.

```solidity
    function redeemWithCt(
        State storage self,
        address owner,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 dsId,
        bytes memory rawCtPermitSig,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal returns (uint256 accruedPa, uint256 accruedRa) {
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        Guard.safeAfterExpired(ds);
        if (deadline != 0) {
            DepegSwapLibrary.permit(ds.ct, rawCtPermitSig, owner, address(this), amount, deadline);
        }
        _separateLiquidity(self, dsId);

        uint256 totalCtIssued = self.psm.poolArchive[dsId].ctAttributed;
        PsmPoolArchive storage archive = self.psm.poolArchive[dsId];

        (accruedPa, accruedRa) = _calcRedeemAmount(amount, totalCtIssued, archive.raAccrued, archive.paAccrued);

        _beforeCtRedeem(self, ds, dsId, amount, accruedPa, accruedRa);

        _afterCtRedeem(self, ds, owner, amount, accruedPa, accruedRa);
    }
```


```solidity
    function unlockTo(PsmRedemptionAssetManager storage self, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        decLocked(self, amount);
        unlockToUnchecked(self, amount, to);
    }

    // @audit revert  because  self.locked is zero 
    function decLocked(PsmRedemptionAssetManager storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.locked = self.locked - amount;
    }    
```

Every call to `unlockTo` function will revert it. 

```solidity

    function _redeemRaWithCtDs(State storage self, DepegSwap storage ds, address owner, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256 ra, uint256 rates)
    {
        rates = ds.exchangeRate();

        ra = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, rates);
@>>        self.psm.balances.ra.unlockTo(owner, ra);
         // Revert 

        ERC20Burnable(ds.ct).burnFrom(owner, amount);
        ERC20Burnable(ds._address).burnFrom(owner, amount);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _afterRedeemWithDs(
        State storage self,
        DepegSwap storage ds,
        address owner,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 feePrecentage
    ) internal returns (uint256 received, uint256 _exchangeRate, uint256 fee) {
        IERC20(ds._address).transferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);

        _exchangeRate = ds.exchangeRate();
        received = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, _exchangeRate);

        fee = MathHelper.calculatePrecentageFee(received, feePrecentage);
        received -= fee;

        IERC20(self.info.peggedAsset().asErc20()).safeTransferFrom(owner, address(this), amount);
    // Revert 
 @!>>       self.psm.balances.ra.unlockTo(owner, received);
    }
```
### Impact

Users are unable to redeem their full entitled RA amount if they only call redeemRaWithCt and do not also call redeemRaWithDs. This leads to locked funds that cannot be withdrawn.

### Tool Used

Manual review

### Recommendation

Alternatively, develop logic to automatically call redeemRaWithDs if redeemRaWithCt was previously called alone, to ensure full RA entitlement can be withdrawn.
