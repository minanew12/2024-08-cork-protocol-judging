# lvRedeemRaWithCtDs() does not account for the RA tokens locked in PSM

## Summary

From README:
```text
In the Vault Deposit, a portion of the Redemption Asset is used to mint Cover Token + Depeg Swap. The Redemption Asset + Cover Token is used to provide liquidity to an an Automated Market Maker (AMM). The vault receives back Liquidity Provider (LP) positions. The Depeg Swaps minted is gradually sold to the AMM via limit orders to accrue more Redemption Asset to the Vault.
```

```text
Liquidity Vault tokenholders can withdraw prior to expiry, the following logic is applied to calculate how many RA they receive per LV:

1. AMM LP Liquidation   
2. Depeg Swap Pairing with Cover Token  
3. Excess Cover Token from the AMM LP liquidation is sold into the AMM to receive Redemption Asset.
4. The fraction of Redemption Asset attributed to the Liquidity Vault tokenholder is added to total amount of Redemption Asset to be withdrawn
5. The amount of Redemption Asset attributed per Liquidity Vault token from steps 1-4, minus a fee can be claimed by the Liquidity Vault tokenholder in exchange for burning their Liquidity Vault token
```

The portion of RA used to mint CT + DS is properly accounted for in the PSM's locked RA balance. However, when users redeem early and burn CT + DS to convert them back into RA, the PSM's locked RA balance is not updated. This leads to an inconsistency in the accounting of RA, as the locked balance does not reflect the actual amount of RA available after redemption.
## Vulnerability Detail

The `deposit()` function in `VaultLib.sol` is responsible for depositing RA into the Liquidity Vault (LV). Internally, it calls `__provideLiquidityWithRatio()`, which uses `__provideLiquidity()`, and eventually calls `PsmLibrary.unsafeIssueToLv()`. This way the amount of RA tokens used to mint CT+DS is accounted in the system.

```solidity
function unsafeIssueToLv(State storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
        uint256 dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;

        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];

        // @audit exchange rate not used
        self.psm.balances.ra.incLocked(amount);

        ds.issue(address(this), amount);
}
```

On the other hand, during the opposite operation, such as in the `redeemEarly()` function, the RA taken when CT + DS are burned is not properly accounted for. `redeemEarly()` calls `_liquidateLpPartial()`, which uses `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()`, ultimately relying on `PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaWithCtDs()`. However, this function burns the CT + DS tokens without adjusting the PSM's locked RA balance, failing to update the systemâ€™s balances properly.

```solidity
function lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(State storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 dsId) internal {
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        ds.burnBothforSelf(amount);
}
```

This incorrect accounting leads to more rewards being distributed than expected for users redeeming RA + PA with CT in the PSM. Over time, this can result in the protocol running out of RA tokens, preventing future users from receiving their rightful rewards. If left unchecked, the depletion of RA tokens could severely impact the protocol's ability to fulfill its obligations, ultimately leading to liquidity issues and undermining the protocol's stability.
## Impact

Over-distribution of rewards + potential DoS
