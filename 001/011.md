# The lvRedeemRaWithCtDs Function Fails to Reduce Locked RA When Burning CT and DS

### Summary

The `PsmLib::lvRedeemRaWithCtDs` function is used to burn Cover Tokens (CT) and Depeg Swaps (DS) when users redeem their vault shares before DS expiry. However, when burning these tokens, the amount of locked Redemption Assets (RA) in the Peg Stability Module (PSM) is not decreased. This oversight impacts the calculation of the amount users receive when redeeming CT at expiry.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the failure to adjust the locked RA in the PSM when CT and DS are burned during the `lvRedeemRaWithCtDs` function when user call `VaultCore::redeemEarlyLv`. This affects the formula used to calculate the share of assets returned to users at expiry.

### Attack Path

A user could exploit this vulnerability by strategically crafting actions to take advantage of the system.

1. Attacker's Initial Deposit to PSM:

*  The attacker deposits 1000 RA into the PSM, receiving 1000 CT and 1000 DS in return.
*  After this deposit, the total locked RA in the PSM is 1000 RA.

2. Other Deposits :

* Other users deposit RA into the Psm/Vault, increasing the total locked RA to 5000.
* The total supply of CT also increases accordingly.

3. Attacker's Deposit to Vault:

* The attacker deposits 20,000 RA into the Vault. the vault call `PsmLib::unsafeIssueToLv` and issued 20,000 CT and 20,000 DS.
* The total locked RA in the PSM increases to 25,000 RA (from the previous 5000 RA).
* The total CT supply at this point is 25,000 CT (including both Vault and PSM deposits).

4. Burning of CT and DS:

* Before the DS expiry, the attacker redeems their Vault shares, burning 20,000 CT and 20,000 DS (`PsmLib::lvRedeemRaWithCtDs`).
* This reduces the total CT supply from 25,000 CT to 5,000 CT.
* However, the locked RA in the PSM remains 25,000 RA


6. Attacker's Redemption at Expiry

* At the time of expiry, the attacker still holds 1000 CT from their initial deposit into the PSM.
* Being the first to redeem, the attacker share of the RA in the PSM is :

   Attacker’s RA = (1000 * 25000) / 5000 = 5000

* The attacker successfully claims 5000 RA from the PSM

### Impact

The failure to decrease the locked Redemption Assets (RA) when a user redeems their Cover Tokens (CT) and Depeg Swaps (DS) from the vault leads to an overestimation of the total locked RA in the PSM. This could drain the balance if there is enough RA or cause transaction failures if the RA balance is insufficient.

### Proof of concept 

Run the poc in test/contracts/LvCore.ts

```ts
it("test RA locked not decrease", async function () {
      const { Id, dsId } = await issueNewSwapAssets(expiry);
      
      await fixture.ra.write.mint([secondSigner.account.address, parseEther("1000")]);
      await fixture.ra.write.approve([moduleCore.address, parseEther("1000")],{account: secondSigner.account.address});
      await moduleCore.write.depositPsm([Id, parseEther("1000")], {account: secondSigner.account.address});

      await fixture.ra.write.mint([defaultSigner.account.address, parseEther("19990")]);
      await fixture.ra.write.approve([moduleCore.address, parseEther("20000")]);
      await moduleCore.write.depositLv([Id, parseEther("20000")]);
      
      await fixture.lv.write.approve([moduleCore.address, parseEther("20000")]);
      await moduleCore.write.redeemEarlyLv([
        Id,
        defaultSigner.account.address,
        parseEther("10000"),
      ]);

      await time.increaseTo(expiry + 1e3);

      const [_, raReceivedPreview] =
        await fixture.moduleCore.read.previewRedeemWithCt([
          Id,
          dsId!,
          parseEther("1000"),
        ]);

      // 1000 * 20 000 / 11 000 = 1818
      // after default user redeem 10 000 ether, ct supply is 11 000 and locked RA 20 000
      console.log(`Second user will receive ${raReceivedPreview.toString()} RA if they redeem CT at expiry`);

    });
```

 
### Mitigation

Decrease amount of locked RA when when burning CT and DS
 
```solidity
    function lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(State storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 dsId) internal {
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        self.psm.balances.ra.decLocked(amount)
        ds.burnBothforSelf(amount);
    }
```
