# Psm::repurchase() doesn't update the RA accounting correctly

### Summary

The [Psm::repurchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L34-L40) function allows users to receive RA asset in exchange for DS and PA tokens. The [Psm::repurchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L34-L40) function calls the [PsmLib::repurchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L293-L322) function:
```solidity
    function repurchase(
        State storage self,
        address buyer,
        uint256 amount,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
    ) internal returns (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 feePrecentage, uint256 fee, uint256 exchangeRates) {
        DepegSwap storage ds;

        (dsId, received, feePrecentage, fee, exchangeRates, ds) = previewRepurchase(self, amount);

        // decrease PSM balance
        // we also include the fee here to separate the accumulated fee from the repurchase
        self.psm.balances.paBalance -= (received);
        self.psm.balances.dsBalance -= (received);

        // transfer user RA to the PSM/LV
        self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);

        // transfer user attrubuted DS + PA
        // PA
        (, address pa) = self.info.underlyingAsset();
        IERC20(pa).safeTransfer(buyer, received);

        // DS
        IERC20(ds._address).transfer(buyer, received);

        // Provide liquidity
        VaultLibrary.provideLiquidityWithFee(self, fee, flashSwapRouter, ammRouter);
    }
```
As can be seen from the above code snippet, the amount of RA tokens that is transferred back to the user is not decreased in the RA accounting.The RA accounting is not properly updated. Which leads to a mismatch between the accounting balance and the actual token balance. This will be problematic when users try to withdraw after the DC and CT tokens have expired, or new CT and DS tokens are issued by the protocol for the existing pair of RA and PA. This will result in last users that try to withdraw loosing their funds, and incorrect calculations for future DS and CT tokens for existing pairs of RA and PA.



### Root Cause

In the [PsmLib::repurchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L293-L322) function, the RA internal accounting is not updated. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Users deposit RA tokens in the protocol via the [Psm::depositPsm()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L90-L101) function, and receive back CT and DS tokens.
2. Users redeem RA assets with PA and DS assets via the [Psm::redeemRaWithDs()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L142-L159) function
3. Users repurchase PA and DS assets with RA assets via the [Psm::repurchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L34-L39) function

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

There is no attack path, this is the way the protocol works.

### Impact

The RA accounting is not properly updated. Which leads to a mismatch between the accounting balance and the actual token balance. This will be problematic when users try to withdraw after  the DC and CT tokens have expired. The first users that withdraw via the [Psm::redeemWithCT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L198-L210) function, will receive more tokens than they should, and the last users to withdraw will receive much less tokens that they should, if any. This results in the first users that withdraw effectively stealing funds from the last users that withdraw. There will also be problems when it comes to calculating the rewards for LV holders, and how much assets should be deposited into a newly created UniV2 pair, for DS and CT tokens that were just issued (the UniV2 pair consists of RA:CT tokens).

[Gist](https://gist.github.com/AtanasDimulski/3f9bfc84c63e1c977b877613b644c0e2)
After following the steps in the above mentioned [gist](https://gist.github.com/AtanasDimulski/3f9bfc84c63e1c977b877613b644c0e2) add the following test to the ``AuditorTests.t.sol`` file:

```solidity
    function test_RepurcahseDoesntUpdateRa() public {
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        /// @notice Set the repruchase fee to 0 for easier calculations
        corkConfig.updateRepurchaseFeeRate(id, 0);

        /// @notice Set the redeemRa fee to 0 for easier calculations
        corkConfig.updatePsmBaseRedemptionFeePrecentage(0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        WETH.mint(alice, 10e18);
        WETH.approve(address(moduleCore), type(uint256).max);
        peggedAsset.mint(alice, 5e18);
        peggedAsset.approve(address(moduleCore), type(uint256).max);
        (, address ds) = moduleCore.swapAsset(id, 1);
        Asset(ds).approve(address(moduleCore), type(uint256).max);
        moduleCore.depositPsm(id, 10e18);

        moduleCore.redeemRaWithDs(id, 1, 5e18);
        console2.log("Actual WETH balance of the contract, without what is deposited in the AMM: ", WETH.balanceOf(address(moduleCore)));
        console2.log("Accounting RA balance: ", moduleCore.valueLocked(id));
        (uint256 paBalance, uint256 dsBalance,) = moduleCore.availableForRepurchase(id);
        console2.log("Accounting PA balance: ", paBalance);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        WETH.mint(bob, 5e18);
        WETH.approve(address(moduleCore), type(uint256).max);
        moduleCore.repurchase(id, 5e18);
        console2.log("Accounting RA balance: ", moduleCore.valueLocked(id));
        console2.log("Actual WETH balance of the contract: ", WETH.balanceOf(address(moduleCore)));
        console2.log("PA balance of bob after repurchase: ", peggedAsset.balanceOf(bob));
        (uint256 paBalance1, uint256 dsBalance1,) = moduleCore.availableForRepurchase(id);
        console2.log("Accounting PA balance: ", paBalance1);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation
In the [PsmLib::repurchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L293-L322) function, decrease the internal accounting balance of the RA token.
