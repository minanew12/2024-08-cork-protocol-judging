# The `PsmLib.repurchase()` function doesn't increase the locked amount of `RA`

## Summary

The `repurchase()` function is invoked when exchanging `RA` for `PA + DS`. It transfers `RA` from users but does not increase the locked amount of `RA`.

## Vulnerability Detail

As noted at line 310 of the `repurchase()` function, the `ra.lockUnchecked()` function is called. The `lockUnchecked()` function only brings the necessary `RA` from the buyer without increasing the locked amount of `RA`. Consequently, `psm.balances.ra.locked` (which represents the amount of locked `RA`) will be less than it should be, resulting in a loss of funds for users, as the locked `RA` will be distributed to users after expiry.

```solidity
PsmLib.sol

    function repurchase(
        State storage self,
        address buyer,
        uint256 amount,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
    ) internal returns (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 feePrecentage, uint256 fee, uint256 exchangeRates) {
        DepegSwap storage ds;

        (dsId, received, feePrecentage, fee, exchangeRates, ds) = previewRepurchase(self, amount);

        // decrease PSM balance
        // we also include the fee here to separate the accumulated fee from the repurchase
        self.psm.balances.paBalance -= (received);
        self.psm.balances.dsBalance -= (received);

        // transfer user RA to the PSM/LV
310     self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);

        // transfer user attrubuted DS + PA
        // PA
        (, address pa) = self.info.underlyingAsset();
        IERC20(pa).safeTransfer(buyer, received);

        // DS
        IERC20(ds._address).transfer(buyer, received);

        // Provide liquidity
        VaultLibrary.provideLiquidityWithFee(self, fee, flashSwapRouter, ammRouter);
    }

-----------------------

RedemptionAssetManagerLib.sol

    function lockUnchecked(PsmRedemptionAssetManager storage self, uint256 amount, address from) internal {
        IERC20(self._address).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
    }
```

## Impact

Loss of `RA` for users.
