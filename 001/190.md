# No UniswapV2 Slippage Protection Enabled

## Summary

At all places when interacting with UniV2 pool the minAmountOut has been hardcoded to 0 essentially meaning 100% slippage tolerance.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) When LP is being liquidated after expiry the following function is invoked in redeemExpired() ->

All of the LP is liquidated here by calling the `removeLiquidity` on the UniV2 AMM pool ->

2.) We can see that all of the LP tokens are passed here but the minimum amounts of Ra and CT have been hardcoded to 0 ->

`(raReceived, ctReceived) =
            ammRouter.removeLiquidity(raAddress, ctAddress, lp, 0, 0, address(this), block.timestamp);`

Meaning any amount returned by the AMM is being accepted and if there's high slippage (very common in UniV2 pools with low liquidity) then the RA/CT returned would be way lesser than expected which is a loss for the user since less tokens will be reserved for redemptions.

## Impact

No slippage protection leads to loss of Ra/Ct tokens received

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a tolerance min out to the liquidity removal.
