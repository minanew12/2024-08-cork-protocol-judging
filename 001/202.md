# Buying DS with RA does not account for the exhange rate between RA: CT+DS

## Summary

From README file:

```text
Buying Depeg Swaps:

1. Buyer sends Redemption Asset into the swap contract 
2. A contract withdraws more Redemption Asset from the AMM
3. The Redemption Asset is used to mint Cover Token and Depeg Swap
4. Depeg Swap is sent to the buyer
5. The Cover Token is sold for Redemption Asset to return the amount from step 2
```

From 3 - RA is used to mint CT+DS but the protocol does not take into consideration the exchange rate when minting CT+DS, leading to a locked funds.
## Vulnerability Detail

The function `__afterFlashswapBuy()` is used during a flash swap to mint CT + DS, send the DS tokens to the user, and return CT tokens to the AMM in exchange for the borrowed RA. However, a significant issue arises due to the unchecked return value from `psm.depositPsm()`.

In this function, `dsAttributed` is assumed to represent the amount of DS the user should receive based on the amount of RA they provided in the `swapRaforDs()` operation. The assumption here is that the exchange rate between RA and DS is 1:1, which is incorrect.
```solidity
function __afterFlashswapBuy(
        ReserveState storage self,
        Id reserveId,
        uint256 dsId,
        address caller,
        uint256 dsAttributed
    ) internal {
        AssetPair storage assetPair = self.ds[dsId];
        assetPair.ra.approve(owner(), dsAttributed);

        IPSMcore psm = IPSMcore(owner());
        psm.depositPsm(reserveId, dsAttributed);

        // should be the same, we don't compare with the RA amount since we maybe dealing
        // with a non-rebasing token, in which case the amount deposited and the amount received will always be different
        // so we simply enforce that the amount received is equal to the amount attributed to the user

        // send caller their DS
        assetPair.ds.transfer(caller, dsAttributed);
        // repay flash loan
        assetPair.ct.transfer(msg.sender, dsAttributed);
    }
```

The `Psm.depositPsm()` function internally calls `PsmLib.deposit()` to calculate the correct amount of DS + CT tokens to mint based on the current exchange rate between RA and DS. However, `__afterFlashswapBuy()` does not account for the actual exchange rate and assumes that providing `X` amount of RA will mint `X` amount of DS, leading to a mismatch.
```solidity
function deposit(State storage self, address depositor, uint256 amount)
        internal
        returns (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 _exchangeRate)
    {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert ICommon.ZeroDeposit();
        }

        dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;

        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];

        Guard.safeBeforeExpired(ds);
        _exchangeRate = ds.exchangeRate();

        received = MathHelper.calculateDepositAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, _exchangeRate);

        self.psm.balances.ra.lockFrom(amount, depositor);

        ds.issue(depositor, received);
    }
```

In `__afterFlashswapBuy()`, the actual amount of DS + CT tokens minted is not considered, as it assumes a 1:1 exchange rate (i.e., 1 RA = 1 DS). This assumption can lead to two issues:

1. Incorrect Token Distribution: If the exchange rate is not 1:1, the amount of DS minted will differ from the `dsAttributed` amount. This discrepancy leads to a miscalculation in the number of tokens sent to the user and those repaid in the flash loan.
2. Locked CT + DS Tokens: Since the function does not correctly account for the exchange rate, CT + DS tokens could remain locked in the contract, causing inefficiencies and potentially leading to incorrect balances being held in the swap contract.
## Impact

An incorrect amount of tokens is distributed, or CT + DS tokens become locked in the contract whenever the exchange rate differs from 1. Since the current implementation assumes a 1:1 exchange rate, this issue will occur anytime the actual exchange rate is different, making the likelihood of this happening **certain** whenever the exchange rate isn't exactly 1:1.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A potential solution with minimal changes would be to check the return values of `psm.deposit()` and handle any unused CT + DS tokens appropriately, such as converting them back to RA. This ensures that no tokens remain locked unnecessarily.
Alternatively, a more comprehensive approach would involve calculating the amount of DS tokens that can be minted based on the current exchange rate upfront. This would allow the existing logic in `__afterFlashswapBuy()` to remain unchanged while ensuring accurate token distribution.
