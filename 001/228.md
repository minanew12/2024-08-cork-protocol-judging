# When users buy `DS`, the `FlashSwapRouter` assumes an exchange rate of `1:1` between `RA` and `CT + DS`

## Summary

When users buy `DS`, the `FlashSwapRouter` assumes an exchange rate of `1:1` between `RA` and `CT + DS`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's consider the scenario where users buy `DS`.

The algorithm is as follows (according to the documentation):

1. Buyer sends Redemption Asset into the swap contract 
2. A contract withdraws more Redemption Asset from the AMM
3. The Redemption Asset is used to mint Cover Token and Depeg Swap
4. Depeg Swap is sent to the buyer
5. The Cover Token is sold for Redemption Asset to return the amount from step 2

The `FlashSwapRouter._swapRaforDs()` function calculates `borrowedAmount`, representing the amount of `RA` borrowed from the Uniswap V2 pool in step 2, by utilizing the `DsFlashSwap.getAmountOutBuyDS()` function (line 109).

```solidity
    function _swapRaforDs(
        ...

109     (amountOut, borrowedAmount,) = assetPair.getAmountOutBuyDS(amount);
        ...
```

The `DsFlashSwap.getAmountOutBuyDS()` function determines `borrowedAmount` by [referencing the `DsSwapperMathLib.getAmountOutDs()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/tree/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/DsFlashSwap.sol#L187) function.

In the `DsSwapperMathLib.getAmountOutDs()` function:

- s: Amount DS user received
- e: RA user provided
- x: RA reserve
- y: CT reserve
- r: RA needed to borrow from AMM

```solidity
    function getAmountOutDs(int256 x, int256 y, int256 e) external pure returns (uint256 r, uint256 s) {
        // first we solve the sqrt part of the equation first

        // E^2
        int256 q1 = e ** 2;
        // 2E(x + y)
        int256 q2 = 2 * e * (x + y);
        // (x - y)^2
        int256 q3 = (x - y) ** 2;

        // q = sqrt(E^2 + 2E(x + y) + (x - y)^2)
        uint256 q = SignedMath.abs(q1 + q2 + q3);
        q = Math.sqrt(q);

        // then we substitue back the sqrt part to the main equation
        // S = (E + x - y + q) / 2

        // r1 = x - y (to absolute, and we reverse the equation)
        uint256 r1 = SignedMath.abs(x - y);
        // r2 = -r1 + q  = q - r1
        uint256 r2 = q - r1;
        // E + r2
        uint256 r3 = r2 + SignedMath.abs(e);

        // S = r3/2 (we multiply by 1e18 to have 18 decimals precision)
        s = (r3 * 1e18) / 2e18;

        // R = s - e (should be fine with direct typecasting)
        r = s - SignedMath.abs(e);
    }
```

At step 2, `(e + r) * RA` is exchanged for `CT + DS`. Assuming the exchange rate between `RA` and `CT + DS` is `ER`, `((e + r) / ER) * (CT + DS)` will be generated. Consequently, `((e + r) / ER) * CT` will be repaid to the Uniswap V2 pool at step 5. Therefore, according to the rules of the Uniswap V2 pool, the following equation should hold:

```solidity
    x * y = (x - r) * (y + (e + r) / ER)
```

However, the `getAmountOutDs()` function omits `ER`, leading to the resolution of the following equation instead:

```solidity
    x * y = (x - r) * (y + (e + r))
```

## Impact

Incorrect calculations can result in a loss of funds.

## Recommendation

The `DsSwapperMathLib.getAmountOutDs()` function should accurately account for the exchange rate between `RA` and `CT + DS` when users buy `DS`.
