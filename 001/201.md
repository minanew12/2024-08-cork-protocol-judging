# No slippage parameter can lead users to receive a smaller amount than expected.

### Summary

Users can be frontrun and receive a smaller amount than expected when attempting to redeem early funds by calling the `ValidLib.sol::redeemEarly()` function. The `UniswapV2Router02.sol::swapExactTokensForTokens()` function is called internally without specifying the amountTokenMin parameter. This opens the trade to potential delays by miners or network congestion, as well as the risk of a sandwich attack, resulting in the user receiving fewer funds than anticipated.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L345
In  `VaultLib.sol:345` hardcoding amountTokenMin to zero creates a lack of slippage protection

### Impact

In the absence of contract slippage protection, the level of impact of the attack is proportional to the level of slippage that the attacker can generate through market manipulation.


### Mitigation

Consider allowing the user to add a custom amountTokenMin parameter as a slippage guard to reduce potential manipulation attacks by mempool snipers.
