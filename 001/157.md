# Missing RA balance update for PSM during LV redemptions will cause incorrect RA balance

### Summary

The failure to update RA balances in the PSM during LV redemptions will cause an incorrect (inflated) RA balance, which can result in issues such as incorrect payouts and the potential for past CT holders to drain more RA than they should be entitled to.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L125

 In PsmLib.sol:lvRedeemRaWithCtDs the function does not decrease the locked RA balance when LV redeems RA with CT/DS, leading to an inflated RA balance in the PSM.
```solidity
function lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(State storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 dsId) internal {
    DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
    ds.burnBothforSelf(amount);
    // Missing delock
}
```
The RA balance was increased during issue
```solidity
    function unsafeIssueToLv(State storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
        uint256 dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;

        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];

        self.psm.balances.ra.incLocked(amount);

        ds.issue(address(this), amount);
    }

```
This will cause incorrect inflated payouts in redeemWithCt

```solidity
function redeemWithCt(State storage self, address owner, uint256 amount, uint256 dsId, ...) internal {
    // ...
    _separateLiquidity(self, dsId);
    
    uint256 totalCtIssued = self.psm.poolArchive[dsId].ctAttributed;
    PsmPoolArchive storage archive = self.psm.poolArchive[dsId];

    (accruedPa, accruedRa) = _calcRedeemAmount(amount, totalCtIssued, archive.raAccrued, archive.paAccrued);
    // ...
}

function _separateLiquidity(State storage self, uint256 prevIdx) internal {
    // ...
    uint256 availableRa = self.psm.balances.ra.convertAllToFree();
    // ...
    self.psm.poolArchive[prevIdx] = PsmPoolArchive(availableRa, availablePa, IERC20(ds.ct).totalSupply());
    // ...
}

// RedemptionAssetManagerLib.sol

function convertAllToFree(PsmRedemptionAssetManager storage self) internal returns (uint256) {
    if (self.locked == 0) {
        return self.free;
    }

    self.free = self.free + self.locked;
    self.locked = 0;

    return self.free;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. LV calls lvRedeemRaWithCtDs to redeem RA with CT/DS -- this is called at several places during liquidation of LV token
2. The PSM's RA balance remains unchanged, becoming inflated
3. Expiry occurs, triggering _separateLiquidity
4. _separateLiquidity uses the inflated RA balance to calculate availableRa
5. CT holders call redeemWithCt after expiry
6. redeemWithCt uses the inflated availableRa to calculate payouts

### Impact

The incorrect RA balance in the PSM can lead to several serious issues:

Incorrect Payouts: CT holders may receive payouts that do not accurately reflect the true amount of RA available in the system. Some users might receive more than their fair share, while others might receive less or nothing at all if all RAs are exhausted.
RA Drainage by Past CT Holders: Due to the inflated RA balance, past CT holders could potentially drain more RA from the system than they should be entitled to after new issuance. This could lead to a situation where the actual RA in the system is depleted before all legitimate claims are satisfied.
System Insolvency: The protocol may attempt to pay out more RA than it actually holds, potentially leading to insolvency if not caught and corrected.

### Mitigation

Update lvRedeemRaWithCtDs to decrease the locked RA balance.
