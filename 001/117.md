# Exchange rate between RA: CT+DS is not used when liquidating LP tokens at expiry

## Summary

From README file:
```text
At expiry, the following operations will occur in the Liquidity Vault:

1. The AMM LP is redeemed to receive Cover Token + Redemption Asset
2. Any excess Depeg Swap in the Liquidity Vault is paired with Cover Token to mint Redemption Asset
3. The excess Cover Token is used to claim Redemption Asset + Pegged Asset as described above
4. End state: Only Redemption Asset + redeemed Pegged Asset remains
```
When minting RA with CT + DS, the process should follow the same exchange rate mechanism between RA and CT + DS, similar to how it's handled when depositing RA into the PSM or when redeeming RA with CT + DS through the PSM. Protocol fails to do correct conversion from CT+DS to RA when during the liquidation process describede above.
## Vulnerability Detail

The `_liquidatedLp()` function in `VaultLib.sol` is called upon DS expiration. Both `redeemExpired()` and `onNewIssuance()` use this function to execute the operations outlined in the report's summary section.

```solidity
function _liquidatedLp(
        State storage self,
        uint256 dsId,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter
    ) internal {
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];

        // if there's no LP, then there's nothing to liquidate
        if (self.vault.config.lpBalance == 0) {
            return;
        }

        // the following things should happen here(taken directly from the whitepaper) :
        // 1. The AMM LP is redeemed to receive CT + RA
        // 2. Any excess DS in the LV is paired with CT to redeem RA
        // 3. The excess CT is used to claim RA + PA in the PSM
        // 4. End state: Only RA + redeemed PA remains

        self.vault.lpLiquidated.set(dsId);

        (uint256 raAmm, uint256 ctAmm) = __liquidateUnchecked(
            self, self.info.pair1, self.ds[dsId].ct, ammRouter, IUniswapV2Pair(ds.ammPair), self.vault.config.lpBalance
        );

        uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);
        uint256 redeemAmount = reservedDs >= ctAmm ? ctAmm : reservedDs;
        PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(self, redeemAmount, dsId); // The following line does operation 2 from above (Any excess DS in the LV is paired with CT to redeem RA)

        // if the reserved DS is more than the CT that's available from liquidating the AMM LP
        // then there's no CT we can use to effectively redeem RA + PA from the PSM
        uint256 ctAttributedToPa = reservedDs >= ctAmm ? 0 : ctAmm - reservedDs;

        uint256 psmPa;
        uint256 psmRa;

        if (ctAttributedToPa != 0) {
            (psmPa, psmRa) = PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaPaWithCt(self, ctAttributedToPa, dsId);
        }

        psmRa += redeemAmount;

        self.vault.pool.reserve(self.vault.lv.totalIssued(), raAmm + psmRa, psmPa);
}
```

```solidity
function lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(State storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 dsId) internal {
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        ds.burnBothforSelf(amount);
}
```

```solidity
function burnBothforSelf(DepegSwap storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
    Asset(self._address).burn(amount);
    Asset(self.ct).burn(amount);
}
```

The current implementation does not account for the exchange rate between RA and DS+CT when burning tokens, resulting in an incorrect amount of RA tokens being minted. Instead, it accounts RA tokens equal to the number of CT/DS tokens burned, which can cause imbalances. If the exchange rate is greater than 1, users will receive fewer RA tokens than they should, leading to reduced rewards. Conversely, if the exchange rate is less than 1, the protocol will mint too many RA tokens, providing more rewards to users than intended. This can lead to an over-distribution of RA tokens, causing imbalances in the system.
## Impact

Depending on the scenarios described in the previous section, this issue can lead to either a loss of rewards for users or an over-distribution of rewards. Over time, this imbalance could break the functionality of the protocol, as it may run out of RA tokens to properly reward all users who provided liquidity into the liquidity vault. Given the high impact on user rewards and the likelihood of occurrence, the overall severity of this issue is high.

## Recommendation

When converting CT+DS to RA, use exchange rate to prevent such imbalances.
