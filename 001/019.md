# Potential Reentrancy in _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt

## Summary
The _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt function in the VaultLib contract is responsible for redeeming CT DS and selling excess CT. This function is critical for the proper functioning of the liquidity and redemption mechanisms in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt handles the redemption of CT DS and the sale of excess CT. It calculates the amount of DS to redeem, updates the reserve, and performs the necessary token swaps. The function ensures that the correct amounts are redeemed and swapped, maintaining the integrity of the protocol's liquidity.

## Impact
If this function is not implemented correctly, it could lead to incorrect redemption amounts, improper token swaps, and potential loss of funds. This could affect the overall liquidity and stability of the protocol.

## Recommendation

Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by updating the state before making external calls.
```solidity
if (ctSellAmount != 0) {
        ERC20(ds.ct).approve(address(ammRouter), ctSellAmount);
        // 100% tolerance, to ensure this not fail
        ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp)[1];
    }
```
