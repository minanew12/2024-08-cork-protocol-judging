# Hardcoded `amountAMin` and `amountBMin`  in `__liquidateUnchecked` function will lead to loss of funds.

## Summary
The values for  `amountAMin` and `amountBMin`  in `__liquidateUnchecked` are set to 0 , this will lead to loss of funds for users.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user redeems LV with the `redeemEarlyLv` or `redeemExpiredLv` functions which both use `__liquidateUnchecked` function which calls ` ammRouter.removeLiquidity` , both of the  `amountAMin` and `amountBMin`  are hardcoded to 0. The protocol states that :"`amountAMin & amountBMin = 0 for 100% tolerence`", but the problem is that calling the function with a lack of slippage protection may cause user to receive unexpected amounts of tokens. A malicious user can take advantage and front run the transaction causing severe loss for the user, which may receive much lower amount or 0 of `(raReceived, ctReceived)`.
## Impact
This issue will lead to loss of funds for users, so the impact will be high.
