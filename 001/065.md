# Incorrect RA Balance Update in repurchase() Function Causes users fund loss

## Summary
The repurchase() function in the PsmLib.sol does not update (increase) the RA balance. As a result, user can't get all their funds later

## Vulnerability Detail
The repurchase function updates paBalance and dsBalance and then calls lockUnchecked() 
```solidity
    function repurchase(
        State storage self,
        address buyer,
        uint256 amount,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
    ) internal returns (uint256 dsId, uint256 received, uint256 feePrecentage, uint256 fee, uint256 exchangeRates) {
        DepegSwap storage ds;

        (dsId, received, feePrecentage, fee, exchangeRates, ds) = previewRepurchase(self, amount);
        //@note received=(amount-fee)/ER

        // decrease PSM balance
        // we also include the fee here to separate the accumulated fee from the repurchase
        self.psm.balances.paBalance -= (received);
        self.psm.balances.dsBalance -= (received);

        // transfer user RA to the PSM/LV
        self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);
```
`lockUnchecked()` transfers the userâ€™s RA tokens to the contract, but it does not increase the RA balance (ra.locked):
```solidity
function lockUnchecked(PsmRedemptionAssetManager storage self, uint256 amount, address from) internal {
        IERC20(self._address).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
    }
```
This causes a mismatch between the actual RA tokens present in the contract and the recorded RA balance. 
When users attempt to redeem their tokens after expiry using redeemWithCt(), the incomplete RA balance prevents them from receiving their full funds.

## Impact
This bug prevents users from fully redeeming their funds after the expiry. It results in a **loss of funds for users**, as they can only redeem the recorded RA balance, which is lower than the actual amount in the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
call lockFrom() function to update ra.locked balance:
```diff
// transfer user RA to the PSM/LV
-        self.psm.balances.ra.lockUnchecked(amount, buyer);
+        self.psm.balances.ra.lockFrom(amount, buyer);

```
