# Locked RA Not Incremented In Repurchase Leads To Lesser Accrued Ra For CT Redemptions

## Summary

Users can repurchase in the PSM where PA and DS are repurchased by providing RA . But the provided RA is not accounted for locked RA leading to lesser accrued PA when CT is redeemed after expiry.
 
## Vulnerability Detail

1.) When user deposits the locked RA increases ->

2.) When user redeems locked amount decreases ->

3.) Users can also repurchase where they provide the redeemed RA by providing DS + PA in the PSM , but the RA amount has not been locked ,

Therefore after expiry when users can redeem their CT and `_separateLiquidity` is invoked ->

lesser amount of RA will be accounted for as `availableRA` ->

Meaning less RA will be accrued overall by the CT tokens.

## Impact

Incorrect accounting of the RA tokens leads incorrect amount redemptions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The provided RA in the repurchase mechanism should be locked.
