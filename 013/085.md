# `getAmountOut` is rounding `amountOut` to extremely low value, losing 18 decimals of precision

### Summary

[getAmountOut](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/DsSwapperMathLib.sol#L96) is missing a multiplication by 1e18 before making the division that calculates `amountOut`. That will result in the final amount to be 0, or at least near 0, losing 18 decimals of precision.

+        amountOut = amountIn * 1e18 / dsPrice;
```
