# Lack of Expiry Time Validation In 'ModuleCore::issueNewDs` Allows Invalid Asset Issuance

## Summary
**Lack of Expiry Time Validation in `ModuleCore::issueNewDs` Allows Invalid Asset Issuance**

The function `ModuleCore::issueNewDs` lacks validation for the `expiry` parameter, enabling the issuance of assets with potentially invalid expiry times. This omission can lead to unexpected behavior and operational issues within the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `ModuleCore::issueNewDs` does not perform any validation checks on the expiry parameter. Without proper validation, new DS assets can be issued with expiry dates that are either in the past or set far into the future, leading to undesirable outcomes such as immediate expiration or indefinite validity. This vulnerability could disrupt the normal functioning of time-sensitive operations within the protocol, such as liquidation schedules and automated processes that rely on correct expiry handling.

## Impact
The absence of expiry time validation introduces the following risks:

1. **Unintended Asset Behavior**: Assets could expire immediately after issuance or remain valid indefinitely, causing operational challenges.
2. **Compromised Protocol Functionality**: Contracts depending on correct expiry times, such as those handling liquidations, transfers, and market operations, may not behave as intended.
3. **Financial Loss** : Improper handling of expired assets may result in market disruption, potential manipulation, and loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, add validation logic to ensure that the `expiry` parameter is within a reasonable range:

1. Ensure that the expiry date is in the future.
2. Set a maximum allowable expiry period (e.g., within a predefined number of years).
3. Consider integrating checks based on the protocol's operational requirements for asset expiry timing.
