# pair.getReserves() return values are not sorted and can lead to wrong calculations

## Summary

When calling the `getReserves()` function in a Uniswap V2 pair contract, itâ€™s essential to also check the `token0` and `token1` of the pair. The reserves returned by `getReserves()` correspond to `token0` and `token1` and are not sorted by token address. Therefore, you cannot directly assign the returned reserve values to specific tokens without first verifying which token corresponds to `token0` and `token1`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation fails to properly check and assign values for RA and CT tokens when querying reserves from a Uniswap V2 pair contract. In cases where `token0` is RA and `token1` is CT, there is no issue. However, since the token order in a pair is determined by lexicographic sorting and is not guaranteed, the reserves may be incorrectly assigned. To avoid this, the contract must always verify whether `token0` or `token1` corresponds to RA or CT and assign reserves accordingly. Without this check, the protocol risks using incorrect reserve values, leading to potential errors in calculations and swaps.

All places where this vulnerability arises can be checked in the Code Snippet section of the report.
## Impact

This issue can lead to a completely unusable protocol due to incorrect calculations based on misassigned reserves. Since many core functions rely on the correct pair reserves, failing to properly check and assign the RA and CT reserves could result in faulty swaps, liquidity provisions, and other operations, rendering the protocol inoperable. Combining this with the high likelihood of this happening (50% chance for every RA:CT pair), the whole severity is High.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do the needed checks to correctly assign the reserve values like how it is done in `FlashSwapRouter.getReservesSorted()`.
