# UniV2 Reserves Being Manipulatable Results In Attacker Getting More RA On Redemption

## Summary

UniswapV2 pools are manipulatable , meaning if the reserve ratio between the assets in the pool is disturbed then the price of the assets would also change , and ratio can be easily manipulated by big trades / flashloans specially for pools with low liquidity . Attacker can leverage this fact and make his LV tokens worth more RA.

## Vulnerability Detail

Attacker can leverage manipulation of the AMM pool as follows ->

1.) Attacker manipulates the reserves (ratio) in the AMM pool of RA/CT (can be done by attacker borrowing RA and then swapping it for CT in the pool or a big trade etc)

2.) Now the reserve ratio has been disturbed , the ratio was disturbed such that when user deposits() into the vault due to the manipulation the AMM ratio has been manipulated and most of the RA goes into the AMM only a little gets converted to Ct + Ds in the PSM(Out of the deposited RA a part of the RA goes to AMM and a part to mint CT and DS but the ratio has been manipulated).

```solidity
function __provideLiquidityWithRatio(
        State storage self,
        uint256 amount,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        address ctAddress,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
    ) internal returns (uint256 ra, uint256 ct) {
        uint256 dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;

        uint256 ctRatio = __getAmmCtPriceRatio(self, flashSwapRouter, dsId);

        (ra, ct) = MathHelper.calculateProvideLiquidityAmountBasedOnCtPrice(amount, ctRatio);

        __provideLiquidity(self, ra, ct, flashSwapRouter, ctAddress, ammRouter, dsId);
    }
```

3.) This creates a RA surplus in the pool , now the attacker can redeem (using redeem early) his LV tokens he received when depositing
and the RA returned would be way more then expected (manipulated reserve ratio) ,

After the  attack is done the reserve ratio would gradually come back to normal due to arbitragers and trading bot activities.

## Impact

Manipulating the reserves can give the attacker the knob to make his RA returns more than expected.
