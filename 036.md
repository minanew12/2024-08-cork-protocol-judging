# Unrestricted State Variable Assignment in VaultPool Reserve Function

## Summary
The `reserve` function in the `VaultPoolLibrary` lacks proper validation checks when setting state variables. This can lead to incorrect or unexpected values being assigned, potentially affecting the integrity and security of the liquidity pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `reserve` function is responsible for updating the balances of the withdrawal and AMM liquidity pools based on provided inputs and calculations from `MathHelper.separateLiquidity`. However, the function does not implement any checks or constraints on the values being assigned to the state variables. This lack of validation can result in:
- Invalid Input Handling: If inputs such as `totalLvIssued`, `addedRa`, or `addedPa` are manipulated or incorrectly calculated, they can lead to erroneous assignments.
- Calculation Errors: If `MathHelper.separateLiquidity` returns unexpected values due to logic errors or edge cases, these values are directly assigned without verification.
- State Inconsistency: The absence of checks can cause the state variables to hold values that do not accurately reflect the contract's intended state, leading to potential inconsistencies and vulnerabilities.
```solidity
    function reserve(VaultPool storage self, uint256 totalLvIssued, uint256 addedRa, uint256 addedPa) internal {
        uint256 totalLvWithdrawn = self.withdrawalPool.atrributedLv;
@=>     self.withdrawalPool.atrributedLv = totalLvWithdrawn;

        // RA
        uint256 totalRa = self.withdrawalPool.raBalance + addedRa;
        (uint256 attributedToWithdraw, uint256 attributedToAmm, uint256 ratePerLv) =
            MathHelper.separateLiquidity(totalRa, totalLvIssued, totalLvWithdrawn);

@=>     self.withdrawalPool.raBalance = attributedToWithdraw;
@=>     self.ammLiquidityPool.balance = attributedToAmm;
@=>     self.withdrawalPool.raExchangeRate = ratePerLv;

        // PA
        uint256 totalPa = self.withdrawalPool.paBalance + addedPa;
        (attributedToWithdraw, attributedToAmm, ratePerLv) =
            MathHelper.separateLiquidity(totalPa, totalLvIssued, totalLvWithdrawn);

@=>     self.withdrawalPool.paBalance = attributedToWithdraw;
@=>     self.withdrawalPool.stagnatedPaBalance = attributedToWithdraw;
@=>     self.withdrawalPool.paExchangeRate = ratePerLv;

        assert(totalRa == self.withdrawalPool.raBalance + self.ammLiquidityPool.balance);
    }
```

## Impact
Exploiting the lack of validation could allow malicious actors to manipulate pool balances, potentially extracting more funds than intended or causing denial of service.
