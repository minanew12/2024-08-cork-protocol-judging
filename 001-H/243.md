# Lack of slippage protection in the `VaultLib` will lead to MEV and users will take losses

### Summary

When users call [VaultLib::redeemEarly()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L639), [VaultLib::_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L318) is called which sells `ct` for `Ra` if there is not enough `Ds` reserve. The [UniswapRouter02::swapExactTokensForTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L345) call does not send a minimum amount out nor a deadline, which means MEV bots are free to do sandwich attacks, which will lead to users getting less `Ra` then they would normally.

### Root Cause

In `VaultLib:345`, no minimum amount out nor deadline is set, which makes it vulnerable to MEV. Other instances in the codebase also do not set these parameters.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is not enough `Ds` reserve and `Ct` has to be swapped for `Ra`.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. MEV bot buys `Ra` for `Ct`.
2. User calls `Vault::redeemEarlyLv()`.
3. MEV bot sells `Ct` for more `Ra` than in 1.

### Impact

Ther user takes a loss.

### PoC

`VaultLib.sol`
```solidity
function _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt(
    State storage self,
    uint256 dsId,
    IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
    IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
    uint256 ammCtBalance
) internal returns (uint256 ra) {
    ...
    if (ctSellAmount != 0) {
        // 100% tolerance, to ensure this not fail
        ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp)[1];
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Let the user send a minimum amount out and deadline.
