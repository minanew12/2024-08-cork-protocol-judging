# Missing slippage protection when redeeming rewards from LV

## Summary

Slippage protection is crucial for ensuring users receive the rewards they expect when removing liquidity or executing a swap in an AMM pair. However, the current protocol implementation does not offer any slippage protection mechanism. Instead, it enforces a 100% tolerance by design to prevent transaction failures, which leaves users vulnerable to receiving less than expected due to unfavorable price movements or liquidity changes.

To enhance user security, the protocol should allow users to specify their acceptable slippage tolerance during transactions. This way, users can control how much price fluctuation they are willing to accept, ensuring they can opt out of transactions if the slippage exceeds their chosen limit.
## Vulnerability Detail

Both the `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()` and `__liquidateUnchecked()` functions execute liquidity removal and swap operations on the AMM pair without providing slippage protection. This lack of slippage safeguards exposes the protocol to **sandwich attacks**, where an attacker can manipulate the price between the time a transaction is initiated and when it is executed.

```solidity
function _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt(
        State storage self,
        uint256 dsId,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        uint256 ammCtBalance
    ) internal returns (uint256 ra) {
        uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);

        uint256 redeemAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? ammCtBalance : reservedDs;

        reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReservePartial(self.info.toId(), dsId, redeemAmount);

        ra += redeemAmount;
        PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(self, redeemAmount, dsId);

        uint256 ctSellAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? 0 : ammCtBalance - reservedDs;

        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        address[] memory path = new address[](2);
        path[0] = ds.ct;
        path[1] = self.info.pair1;

        ERC20(ds.ct).approve(address(ammRouter), ctSellAmount);

        if (ctSellAmount != 0) {
            // 100% tolerance, to ensure this not fail
            ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp)[1];
        }
    }

```

```solidity
function __liquidateUnchecked(
        State storage self,
        address raAddress,
        address ctAddress,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
        IUniswapV2Pair ammPair,
        uint256 lp
    ) internal returns (uint256 raReceived, uint256 ctReceived) {
        ammPair.approve(address(ammRouter), lp);

        // amountAMin & amountBMin = 0 for 100% tolerence
        (raReceived, ctReceived) =
            ammRouter.removeLiquidity(raAddress, ctAddress, lp, 0, 0, address(this), block.timestamp);

        (raReceived, ctReceived) = MinimalUniswapV2Library.reverseSortWithAmount224(
            ammPair.token0(), ammPair.token1(), raAddress, ctAddress, raReceived, ctReceived
        );

        self.vault.config.lpBalance -= lp;
    }
```
## Impact

Loss of funds for the users who withdraw their rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review
## Recommendation

Slippage parameters should be included in the transaction and specified by the users to prevent such scenarios.
