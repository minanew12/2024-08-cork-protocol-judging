# Deadline is set to `block.timestamp`, which may cause unwanted price for user.

## Summary
The deadline in multiple functions is set to `block.timestamp` , this sets the limit in which a transaction can be executed.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `__addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked`,`_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt` and specifically in `__liquidateUnchecked` function the deadline is set to `block.timestamp`. 
As stated in [DefiHacksLabs](https://defihacklabs.substack.com/p/solidity-security-lesson-6-defi-slippage?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2#%C2%A7no-expiration-deadline), `Protocols shouldn't set the deadline to block.timestamp as a validator can hold the transaction and the block it is eventually put into will be block.timestamp, so this offers no protection.`
This may cause significantly worse price for the user when liquidating.
## Impact
Setting deadline to `block.timestamp` allows `block.validators` to include the transaction in different time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
User should be allowed to input deadline , and also the protocol must implement checks for deadline as well.
