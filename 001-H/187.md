# On-chain calculated tolerance does not provide slippage protection when depositing into LV

## Summary

When users deposit into the Liquidity Vault (LV), a portion of their RA is converted to CT + DS tokens, and CT + RA is provided as liquidity to the AMM pair. The protocol sets a tolerance level to ensure that at least a certain amount of RA and CT is successfully provided. However, this tolerance is calculated on-chain using the current state of the AMM reserves, which are subject to change. An attacker could frontrun the transaction, manipulating the reserves and leave the user deposit RA in a state where RA price ratio to CT is very low.
## Vulnerability Detail 
The function `__addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked()` is responsible for adding liquidity to the AMM by calculating the tolerance for the amount of RA and CT tokens to be provided. The tolerance is determined on-chain using the current state of the AMM's reserves:
```solidity
    function __addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked(
        State storage self,
        uint256 raAmount,
        uint256 ctAmount,
        address raAddress,
        address ctAddress,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
    ) internal {
        (uint256 raTolerance, uint256 ctTolerance) =
            MathHelper.calculateWithTolerance(raAmount, ctAmount, MathHelper.UNIV2_STATIC_TOLERANCE);

        ERC20(raAddress).approve(address(ammRouter), raAmount);
        ERC20(ctAddress).approve(address(ammRouter), ctAmount);

        (address token0, address token1, uint256 token0Amount, uint256 token1Amount) =
            MinimalUniswapV2Library.sortTokensUnsafeWithAmount(raAddress, ctAddress, raAmount, ctAmount);
        (,, uint256 token0Tolerance, uint256 token1Tolerance) =
            MinimalUniswapV2Library.sortTokensUnsafeWithAmount(raAddress, ctAddress, raTolerance, ctTolerance);

        (,, uint256 lp) = ammRouter.addLiquidity(
            token0, token1, token0Amount, token1Amount, token0Tolerance, token1Tolerance, address(this), block.timestamp
        );

        self.vault.config.lpBalance += lp;
    }
```

The `raAmount` and `ctAmount` to be provided are calculated based on the current reserves of the pair through the `__provideLiquidityWithRatio()` function:
```solidity
 function __provideLiquidityWithRatio(
        State storage self,
        uint256 amount,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        address ctAddress,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
    ) internal returns (uint256 ra, uint256 ct) {
        uint256 dsId = self.globalAssetIdx;

        uint256 ctRatio = __getAmmCtPriceRatio(self, flashSwapRouter, dsId);

        (ra, ct) = MathHelper.calculateProvideLiquidityAmountBasedOnCtPrice(amount, ctRatio);

        __provideLiquidity(self, ra, ct, flashSwapRouter, ctAddress, ammRouter, dsId);
    }
```

```solidity
function __provideLiquidity(
        State storage self,
        uint256 raAmount,
        uint256 ctAmount,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        address ctAddress,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
        uint256 dsId
    ) internal {
        // no need to provide liquidity if the amount is 0
        if (raAmount == 0 && ctAmount == 0) {
            return;
        }

        PsmLibrary.unsafeIssueToLv(self, ctAmount);

        __addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked(self, raAmount, ctAmount, self.info.redemptionAsset(), ctAddress, ammRouter);

        _addFlashSwapReserve(self, flashSwapRouter, self.ds[dsId], ctAmount);
    }
```

The vulnerability arises because the RA and CT amounts (along with the tolerance levels) are calculated on-chain based on the current state of the AMM reserves. This opens up the possibility for an attacker to frontrun the transaction and manipulate the reserves of the AMM pair just before the userâ€™s deposit is processed. By doing so, the attacker can create a sandwich attack by manipulating the price ratio.

Consider the following scenario:

1. Current price ratio is ~1:1 and there is not much liquidity in the pair
2. User deposits large amount of RA:CT tokens
3. Attacker frontruns the transaction and execute swap to change the ratio between assets to make RA being cheap compared to CT.
4. User transaction gets executed, providing large amount of RA and low amount of CT (because of the new price ratio)
5. Attacker executes his second transaction, swapping his CT to get RA.
## Impact

This would results in imbalances in the vault regarding the CT and RA balances which later can lead to loss of rewards for users as they would have provided much more RA than they would get when liquidating LP. Likelihood of this happening is high as attacker has direct financial incentives, making the overall severity High.
