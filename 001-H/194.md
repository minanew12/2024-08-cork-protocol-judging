Agreeable Plastic Rooster

Medium

# 100% tolerance might cause problems

## Summary
The protocol uses 0 as slippage parameter to ensure that the transaction should not revert. However, it can be problematic in certain scenarios.
## Vulnerability Detail
Take a look at ``_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()``
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L318-L347

Here, the protocol is trying to use ``swapExactTokensForTokens`` to swap by providing 0 as slippage parameter. 
But the problem by providing no slippage parameter is that it is vulnerable to sandwhich attacks and final ra value is forced to be less than what is expected. 

There is one more place where lack of slippage parameter can cause problems

## Impact
Less output amount than what is intended

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure a minimum slippage parameter provided.
