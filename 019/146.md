# raBalance and paBalance Not Decremented When Redeeming Excess

## Summary

When redeem() is invoked , user's LV is redeemed for RA and PA and after redemption the raBalance and paBalance are adjusted , but if the redemption was an excess redemption then the raBalance and paBalance have not been adjusted .

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) When redeeming after expiry the LP is liquidated and redeem is invoked ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L549

But this can be an excess redeem too , which is a redeem where DS has been expired and now the user can redeem LV which was not requested pre expiry.

2.) In the redeem() since we are redeeming excess (In an excess redeem we would still need to decrement the raBalance and paBalance since there can be some LV which were requested pre expiry and some which were excess) ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultPoolLib.sol#L89

`_redeemExcessFromPool` calls `__tryRedeemExcessFromAmmPool` ->


```solidity
function __tryRedeemfromWithdrawalPool(VaultPool storage self, uint256 amount)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 ra, uint256 pa)
    {
        ra = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, self.withdrawalPool.raExchangeRate);

        pa = MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(amount, self.withdrawalPool.paExchangeRate);
    }

    function __tryRedeemExcessFromAmmPool(VaultPool storage self, uint256 amountAttributed, uint256 excessAmount)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 ra, uint256 pa, uint256 withdrawnFromAmm)
    {
        (ra, pa) = __tryRedeemfromWithdrawalPool(self, amountAttributed);

        withdrawnFromAmm =
            MathHelper.calculateRedeemAmountWithExchangeRate(excessAmount, self.withdrawalPool.raExchangeRate);

        ra += withdrawnFromAmm;
    }
```

And nowhere is `self.withdrawalPool.raBalance -= ra;` and `self.withdrawalPool.paBalance -= pa;` decremented like they are decremented for a non excess redemotion here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultPoolLib.sol#L133 .

3.) This means `self.withdrawalPool.raBalance` `self.withdrawalPool.paBalance` is accounting more value than the correct one , therefore , when reserve() is called for the next iteration the `totalRa` will be storing incorrect value ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultPoolLib.sol#L17

4.) And the values `(uint256 attributedToWithdraw, uint256 attributedToAmm, uint256 ratePerLv)` would be incorrect since an incorrect 
`totalRa` was passed here ->

`MathHelper.separateLiquidity(totalRa, totalLvIssued, totalLvWithdrawn)`

The ratePerLv will be higher and users get more than expected Ra AND PA.

## Impact

Incorreect redemption amounts due to not accounting raBalance and paBalance atfer excess redemptions.
