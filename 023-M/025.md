# User can avoid fees by redeeming RA with CT and DS tokens

### Summary

The lack of fee calculation in the `redeemRaWithCtDs` function will cause an economic imbalance for the protocol as users will avoid fees by redeeming RA with both CT and DS tokens.


### Root Cause

In `Psm.sol` the `redeemRaWithCtDs` function does not include fee calculation or application.

Example:
- In [`Psm.sol:242-277`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/Psm.sol#L242-L277) there is no fee calculation in the `redeemRaWithCtDs` function.
- In [`PsmLib.sol:194-212`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L194-L212) the `redeemRaWithCtDs` function does not handle fee calculation or application.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `redeemRaWithCtDs` to redeem RA with both CT and DS tokens.
2. The `redeemRaWithCtDs` function must be called without any fee calculation logic.


### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `redeemRaWithCtDs` in `Psm.sol` to redeem RA with both CT and DS tokens.
2. The function `redeemRaWithCtDs` in `PsmLib.sol` is called internally without any fee calculation.
3. User receives the full amount of RA without any fees being deducted.


### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of fees that should have been collected. The attacker gains by avoiding these fees.

### PoC

1. User has 1000 RA tokens and wants to redeem them.
2. User calls `redeemRaWithCtDs` with 1000 RA tokens and avoids the 1% fee, receiving the full amount without any deduction.

Example code:
```solidity
function redeemRaWithCtDs(
    Id id,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory rawDsPermitSig,
    uint256 dsDeadline,
    bytes memory rawCtPermitSig,
    uint256 ctDeadline
) external override nonReentrant PSMWithdrawalNotPaused(id) {
    State storage state = states[id];
    (uint256 ra, uint256 dsId, uint256 rates) =
        state.redeemRaWithCtDs(_msgSender(), amount, rawDsPermitSig, dsDeadline, rawCtPermitSig, ctDeadline);

    emit Cancelled(id, dsId, _msgSender(), ra, amount, rates);
}
```

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, add fee calculation and application in the `redeemRaWithCtDs` function.
