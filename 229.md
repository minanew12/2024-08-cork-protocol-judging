# Incrementing globalAssetIdx will prevent first-issuance liquidity handling logic from executing correctly

### Summary

The premature increment of `globalAssetIdx` will cause a failure in handling the first issuance for liquidity providers, as the contract logic will always pass a non-zero index to the `VaultLibrary.onNewIssuance` function, skipping the intended logic for handling the first issuance.

### Root Cause

In [ModuleCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleCore.sol#L57-L86)  there is  `issueNewDs` function, the increment of [globalAssetIdx](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/ModuleCore.sol#L70) happens before it is passed to the `VaultLibrary.onNewIssuance` function, causing the `prevDsId` to never be 0 during the first issuance.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin needs to call `issueNewDs()` for the first issuance of a new asset.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Admin calls `issueNewDs()` for the first time.
`globalAssetIdx` is incremented before the onNewIssuance function is called, ensuring that `prevDsId` is always non-zero.


### Impact

The liquidity providers and participants in the first issuance suffer the inability to correctly handle liquidity during the initial issuance process, potentially resulting in incomplete or mismanaged liquidity pools for the new asset.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of incrementing `globalAssetIdx` immediately, the contract should check if it is the first issuance and handle the logic accordingly before incrementing the index. A dedicated flag could be introduced to track whether it's the first issuance, ensuring that the correct logic is applied for the first issuance without relying on `globalAssetIdx`.
