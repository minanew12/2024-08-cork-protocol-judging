# [H-04] Arbitrary transferFrom

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
What is the Arbitrary transferFrom vulnerability?
The ERC-20 standard interface specifies a transferFrom() function, which can be used to transfer tokens between two specified accounts. In some implementations, the from address may be vulnerable to attacks that allow anyone to spend another user's token balance.

https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/

As a result, a best practice is to ensure that the from address in a call to transferFrom() is the msg.sender value, particularly when calling an ERC-20 implementation that you did not author.

A real-world example: undisclosed live ERC-20 contracts
In 2018, a blockchain security research firm uncovered multiple undisclosed ERC-20 implementations that were vulnerable to the Arbitrary transferFrom vulnerability. These contracts did not properly check the allowance of tokens allotted to the message sender from the from address, allowing users to spend tokens held by any address with a balance.

Olympix: Calling transferFrom functionality with a parameterized from value may lead to theft or loss of tokens.

## Recommendation

Use msg.sender as the from parameter when calling transferFrom.
