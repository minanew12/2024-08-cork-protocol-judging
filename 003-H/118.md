# Exchange rate between RA:CT+DS is not used when liquidating LP tokens during early redeem

## Summary

From README file: 
```text
Liquidity Vault tokenholders can withdraw prior to expiry, the following logic is applied to calculate how many RA they receive per LV:

1. AMM LP Liquidation   
2. Depeg Swap Pairing with Cover Token  
3. Excess Cover Token from the AMM LP liquidation is sold into the AMM to receive Redemption Asset.
4. The fraction of Redemption Asset attributed to the Liquidity Vault tokenholder is added to total amount of Redemption Asset to be withdrawn
5. The amount of Redemption Asset attributed per Liquidity Vault token from steps 1-4, minus a fee can be claimed by the Liquidity Vault tokenholder in exchange for burning their Liquidity Vault token
```
When minting RA with CT + DS, the process should follow the same exchange rate mechanism between RA and CT + DS, similar to how it's handled when depositing RA into the PSM or when redeeming RA with CT + DS through the PSM. Protocol fails to do correct conversion from CT+DS to RA when during the liquidation process described above (operation 2).
## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises when users redeem early from the Liquidity Vault. In the `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()` function, the exchange rate between RA and CT+DS is not applied during the redemption process, leading to an incorrect amount of RA tokens being credited. This can result in over-rewarding or under-rewarding users, depending on the current exchange rate. If the exchange rate is greater than 1, users will receive fewer RA tokens than they should, leading to reduced rewards. Conversely, if the exchange rate is less than 1, the protocol will mint too many RA tokens, providing more rewards to users than intended. This can lead to an over-distribution of RA tokens, causing imbalances in the system.

```solidity
function _redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt(
        State storage self,
        uint256 dsId,
        IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter,
        IDsFlashSwapCore flashSwapRouter,
        uint256 ammCtBalance
    ) internal returns (uint256 ra) {
        uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);

        uint256 redeemAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? ammCtBalance : reservedDs;

        reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReservePartial(self.info.toId(), dsId, redeemAmount);

         // @audit exchange rate is not used
        ra += redeemAmount;
        PsmLibrary.lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(self, redeemAmount, dsId);

        uint256 ctSellAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? 0 : ammCtBalance - reservedDs;

        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        address[] memory path = new address[](2);
        path[0] = ds.ct;
        path[1] = self.info.pair1;

        ERC20(ds.ct).approve(address(ammRouter), ctSellAmount);

        if (ctSellAmount != 0) {
            // 100% tolerance, to ensure this not fail
            // @audit can this 100% tolerance be exploited + one more place with 100% tolerance
            ra += ammRouter.swapExactTokensForTokens(ctSellAmount, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp)[1];
        }
    }
```

```solidity
function lvRedeemRaWithCtDs(State storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 dsId) internal {
        DepegSwap storage ds = self.ds[dsId];
        ds.burnBothforSelf(amount);
}
```

```solidity
function burnBothforSelf(DepegSwap storage self, uint256 amount) internal {
    Asset(self._address).burn(amount);
    Asset(self.ct).burn(amount);
}
```

## Impact

Depending on the scenarios described in the previous section, this issue can lead to either a loss of rewards for users or an over-distribution of rewards. Over time, this imbalance could break the functionality of the protocol, as it may run out of RA tokens to properly reward all users who provided liquidity into the liquidity vault. Given the high impact on user rewards and the likelihood of occurrence, the overall severity of this issue is high.

## Recommendation

When converting CT+DS to RA, use exchange rate to prevent such imbalances.
