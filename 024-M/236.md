# `VaultLib::__addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked()` does not deal with the remaining amounts not sent to the amm, losing them

### Summary

[VaultLib::__addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L55) sets a [tolerance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L63-L64) for the `Ra` and `Ct` tokens to provide liquidity, which means it will not revert in case the tokens up to the tolerance are not provided as liquidity to the `Amm`. However, it does not [track](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L74-L76) the funds that were not provided to the liquidity, leaving them untracked in the `Vault`.

### Root Cause

In `VaultLib:45`, the remaining `Ra` and `Ct` not provided as liquidity are left untracked and are lost.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

`VaultLib::__addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked()` is called by `VaultLib::__provideLiquidity()`, called by `VaultLib::__provideLiquidityWithRatio()` or `__provideAmmLiquidityFromPool()`, called when a fee is minted from user actions or a new issuance is started.

### Impact

The protocol is left with stuck `Ra` and `Ct`.

### PoC

`VaultLib.sol`
```solidity
function __addLiquidityToAmmUnchecked(
    State storage self,
    uint256 raAmount,
    uint256 ctAmount,
    address raAddress,
    address ctAddress,
    IUniswapV2Router02 ammRouter
) internal {
    (uint256 raTolerance, uint256 ctTolerance) =
        MathHelper.calculateWithTolerance(raAmount, ctAmount, MathHelper.UNIV2_STATIC_TOLERANCE);
    ...
    (,, uint256 lp) = ammRouter.addLiquidity( //@audit remaining amounts are not checked
        token0, token1, token0Amount, token1Amount, token0Tolerance, token1Tolerance, address(this), block.timestamp
    );
    ...
}
```

### Mitigation

Get the actually provided amounts and track the unprovided to liquidity amounts to be dealt with.
