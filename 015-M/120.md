# Exchange Rate Has Been Hardcoded For Assets

## Summary

Once the exchange rate for an asset has been set it remains same forever ,but in reality a rebasing token would not remain the same value as compared to the underlying asset i.e.  wsteEth is trading at 1.17 ETH right now but it might be trading at 1.4 ETH in future.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The exchange rate for an asset is set here ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/core/assets/Asset.sol#L20

2.) But this approach is incorrect , taking the example from their own docs , 

```solidity
 Lido steth is a rebasing token but most of the liquidity and DeFi integrations for steth are in wsteth which trades at 1.17 eth per wsteth. To address this, there is an Exchange Rate or ER in the Peg Stability Module that is fixed for each expiry between the Redemption Asset and Pegged Asset. The Exchange Rate determines how many Redemption Assets you need to deposit to receive 1 Cover Token + 1 Depeg Swap and how many Redemption Assets you receive when redeeming 1 Pegged Asset + 1 Depeg Swap. 
```

therefore for steETH accounting for the exchange rate , you would need to deposit 1.17 steETH to receive 1 CT and 1 DS.

But the rebase might change and steETH might be trading at 1.4 eth  and that would mean the exchange rate is incorrect now , users can still deposit 1.17 to receive 1 Ct and 1 Ds while it should be 1.4 . The cover tokens and depeg swaps will be available for cheap in this case.


## Impact

Hardcoding exchange rate is incorrect since rebasing tokens will accrue more value with time and due to this users can claim 1 CT and 1 DS for cheaper than expected and redeem them later for PA.

## Recommendation

The exchange rate should be estimated based on the market conditions not hardcoded.
