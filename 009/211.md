# Withdrawing all `lv` before expiry will lead to lost funds in the Vault

### Summary

[VaultLib:redeemEarly()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L639) redeems users' liquidity vault positions, `lv` for `Ra`, [before](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L649) expiry. After expiry, it is not possible to deposit into the vault or redeem early.

Whenever all users redeem early, when it gets to the expiry date, [VaultLib::_liquidatedLp()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L349) is called to remove the lp position from the `AMM` into `Ra` and `Ct` (redeem from the `PSM` into more `Ra` and `Pa`) and split among all `lv` holders.

However, as the total supply of `lv` is `0` due to users having redeemed all their positions via `VaultLib::redeemEarly()`, when it gets to [VaultPoolLib::reserve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L392), it [reverts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultPoolLib.sol#L19) due to a division by `0` [error](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/MathHelper.sol#L134), never allowing the `Vault::_liquidatedLp()` call to go through. 

As the `Ds` has expired, it is also not possible to deposit into it to increase the `lv` supply, so all funds are forever stuck.

### Root Cause

In `MathHelper:134`, the `ratePerLv` reverts due to division by 0. It should calculate the rate after the return guard that checks if the `totalLvIssued == 0`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. All users must redeem early.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. All users redeem early via `Vault::redeemEarlyLv()`.
2. The `Ds` expires and there is no `lv` tokens, making all funds stuck.

### Impact

All funds are stuck.

### PoC

The `MathHelper` separates liquidity by calculating first the `ratePerLv`, which will trigger a division by 0 revert.
```solidity
function separateLiquidity(uint256 totalAmount, uint256 totalLvIssued, uint256 totalLvWithdrawn)
    external
    pure
    returns (uint256 attributedWithdrawal, uint256 attributedAmm, uint256 ratePerLv)
{
    // with 1e18 precision
    ratePerLv = ((totalAmount * 1e18) / totalLvIssued);

    // attribute all to AMM if no lv issued or withdrawn
    if (totalLvIssued == 0 || totalLvWithdrawn == 0) {
        return (0, totalAmount, ratePerLv);
    }
    ...
}
```

### Mitigation

The `MathHelper` should place the return guard first:
```solidity
function separateLiquidity(uint256 totalAmount, uint256 totalLvIssued, uint256 totalLvWithdrawn)
    external
    pure
    returns (uint256 attributedWithdrawal, uint256 attributedAmm, uint256 ratePerLv)
{
    // attribute all to AMM if no lv issued or withdrawn
    if (totalLvIssued == 0 || totalLvWithdrawn == 0) {
        return (0, totalAmount, 0);
    }
    ...
    // with 1e18 precision
    ratePerLv = ((totalAmount * 1e18) / totalLvIssued);
}
```
