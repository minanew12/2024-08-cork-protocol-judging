# User can redeem extra `ra` in exchange of `ct` token.



## Summary

A vulnerability has been identified in the function `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()` within the `Vault` smart contract. This function is designed to convert `ct` and `ds` tokens to `ra` tokens and handle any excess `ct` tokens by swapping them to `ra`. However, due to a flaw in how the remaining `ds` tokens (`reservedDs`) are handled and how the excess `ct` tokens (`ctSellAmount`) are calculated, the function can result in giving more `ra` tokens to the user than expected. This can lead to an unintended loss of assets for the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The execution flow is as follows:

1. `Vault:redeemEarlyLv` → `VaultLib:redeemEarly()` → `_liquidateLpPartial()` → `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()`
2. The vulnerability exists in the function `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()`.

The function `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()` pairs `ct` and `ds` tokens to convert them into `ra` tokens. If there are excess `ct` tokens remaining, it swaps them to `ra`. However, due to a flaw, this function can give more `ra` tokens than expected.

### Analysis of `_redeemCtDsAndSellExcessCt()`

First, it retrieves the total reserved `ds` tokens:

```solidity
uint256 reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.getLvReserve(self.info.toId(), dsId);
```

Then, it calculates `redeemAmount`:

```solidity
uint256 redeemAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? ammCtBalance : reservedDs;
```

`redeemAmount` is subtracted from `reservedDs`, and the remaining `reservedDs` is returned:

```solidity
reservedDs = flashSwapRouter.emptyReservePartial(self.info.toId(), dsId, redeemAmount);
```

The `redeemAmount` of `ct` and `ds` tokens is burned. Next, the code calculates the `ctSellAmount`, which intends to compute the excess `ct` tokens:

```solidity
uint256 ctSellAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? 0 : ammCtBalance - reservedDs; // <= @audit
```

Here, `reservedDs` is the updated balance, while `ammCtBalance` has not changed.

### Proof of Concept

Let's assume:
- `reservedDs = 700`
- `ammCtBalance = 400`

Then:

1. `redeemAmount = 400`
2. New `reservedDs = 700 - 400 = 300`
3. `ra += 400` → `ra = 400`
4. `ctSellAmount = reservedDs >= ammCtBalance ? 0 : ammCtBalance - reservedDs`
   - `ctSellAmount = 300 >= 400 ? 0 : 400 - 300 = 100`

As a result, more `ra` is given to the user after the excess `ct` is swapped to `ra` in the following code.

## Impact

The incorrect calculation of the `ctSellAmount` allows users to receive more `ra` tokens than they are entitled to. This can lead to a loss of assets from the protocol, making it vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors who can repetitively take advantage of the flaw to drain funds.
