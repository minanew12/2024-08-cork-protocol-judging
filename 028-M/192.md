# VaultLib: `__provideLiquidity` does not update state correctly

### Summary

The function [__provideLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/VaultLib.sol#L153-L172) calls [PsmLibrary.unsafeIssueToLv](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L115-L123) with an CT amount while `unsafeIssueToLv` updates a RA amount. This will lead to issues with wrong amounts in RA locked.

### Root Cause

In [PsmLib.sol:120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-cork-protocol/blob/main/Depeg-swap/contracts/libraries/PsmLib.sol#L115-L123) the contract increases the locked amount of RA. But the calling function `__provideLiquidity` passes a CT amount to the function. The `unsafeIssueToLv` should convert the CT amount to an RA amount first.

### Mitigation

Convert the CT amount to RA, or just pass the RA amount from `__provideLiquidity` to `unsafeIssueToLv` as well.
